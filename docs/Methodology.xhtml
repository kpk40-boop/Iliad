        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <section>
        <h2>What Our Project Is</h2>
            <p>Our project is aimed at showing the ambiguity in the Iliad around the word <em>Andros</em>. Andros means both <em>man</em> and <em>husband</em>, but overtime different translations have come to 
        choose one translated word over another depending on a specific relationship. We use the three versions of the Iliad (the Greek, Butler, and Wilson version) to analyze the word usage with 
        the relationship between Achilles and Patroklos, who have been thought to have been in a romantic relationship, and the relationship between Menelaus and Helen. </p>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>
        <p>We started off gathering the translations that we wanted to use. We used the Greek TEI text, the Butler (english) TEI translation, and quotes from the newer Wilson (english) translation. 
            Katie went into the Greek version of the text and found every instance of the word <em>Andros</em>. At the same time, Isa and Cheyenne went into the Butler version. searched for, and markedup every 
            instance of the words <em>man</em> and <em>husband</em> and performed a close reading of the text to desipher the context and character the word was referring to. Kosi made the schemas for both the Butler 
            and Greek versions of the Iliad and did the XSLT for our corpus. After this, we wanted to center our project on Achilles and Patroklos, so Cheyenne went into the physical Wilson text 
            and found the instances of the word man and husband in relation to the Butler version for Achilles and Patroklos and Meneleus and Helen of which there were 16. She then made an XML document 
            marking these instances up and giving each one a unique ID and adding those to the Butler TEI. Katie went and found these instances in the Greek version, gave them the same unique ID's, and created
            the XSLT. After our research was concluded, we started designing the website. Isa designed the contact and characters pages using XHTML and CSS, Cheyenne and Kosi created the methodology page and the
            chart.

        <h2>Findings</h2>
       <p> Our group noticed that for Achilles and Patroklos,
           the word <em>man</em> was used as well as other phrases like <em>comrade</em> or even friend, but between Meneleus and Helen <em>husband</em> was used. Specifically in the Butler version, we notice man being used 
           repeatedly for Achilles and Patroklos. However, in the Wilson version, the newer translation, man is also used but so is comrade and even the phrase <em>the man that I love</em> spoken by Achilles 
        towards Patroklos. Based on these findings, we want to show how the term Andros is ambiguous and depends on the context in which it is used.</p>

         <h2>What the Bar Charts show</h2>
        <p>We wanted to show how the word for man and husband in the Greek was split up depending on the character in the Butler translation.</p>
