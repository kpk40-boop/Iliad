    <!-- NOTES FOR THE TEAM:
    
    This is the new syntax I'm using for important comments you should read for directions. If you see a bar like above, you should read it all.
    
    I made a number of changes to this Wilson doc, and I'm going to suggest a few more.
        - I renumbered these for the sake of chronology, so that they match with the text, and ordered them accordingly. This will make it easier for you to create a reading view.
        - I commented out the scrolls, they didn't serve a structural purpose to me. I changed the schema to match.
            - I suggest the same with the line numbers, which don't really serve a purpose. You don't want to overcomplicate your code. Take them out or justify them.
            - I also added some attributes to "u" which are important and will make scraping easier for you.
                - The attribute "g-word" means Greek word. It is upposed to be the word that this quote is marked up to concern in Greek. It can only be "anḗr."
                - The attribute "b-word" means Butler Word. It is supposed to be the word that this quote is marked up to concern in Butler. It can be one of four values:
                    - Values are "man," "husband," comrade," "none,"
                - The attribute "w-word" means Wilson word. It is supposed to be the word that this quote is marked up to concern in Wilson. It can be one of five values:
                    - Values are "man," "husband," comrade," "person," "none,"
                - The attribute "char" means character. Who is the word applying to?
                    - Values are "Achilles," "Patroklos," and "Menelaus"
                        - I also regexed every "Patroclus" to read "Patroklos"
                - It's basically consolidating what you've already done into this one element, again, for scraping purposes
