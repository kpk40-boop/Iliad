            who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly
            away. "Old <span class="man">man</span>," said he, "let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor
            yet coming hereafter. Your scepter of the god and your wreath shall profit you
            nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old </div>
         <div>
            in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and
            visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for
            you." The old <span class="man">man</span> feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the
            shore of the sounding sea </div>
         <div>
            A plain<span class="man">man</span>cannot stand against the anger of a
            king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has
            wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will protect me." And
            Achilles answered, </div>
         <div>
            But of this we will take thought hereafter; for
            the present, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her
            expressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis also;
            further, let some chief <span class="man">man</span> among us be in command, </div>
         <div>
            from heaven (for Hera had sent her in the love
            she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow hair,
            visible to him alone, for of the others no <span class="man">man</span> could see her. Achilles turned
            in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew that she was
            </div>
         <div>
            "Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a
            <span class="man">man</span> may be, he must do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods
            ever hear the prayers of him who has obeyed them." He stayed his hand on the
            silver hilt of his sword, </div>
         <div>
            rob his prizes from any <span class="man">man</span> who contradicts
            you. You devour your people, for you are king over a feeble folk; otherwise,
            son of Atreus, henceforward you would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear
            it with a great oath - nay, by this my scepter which shall sprout neither leaf
            nor shoot, </div>
         <div>
            for they would have me come, and I fought as it
            was in me to do. Not a <span class="man">man</span> now living could withstand them, but they heard my
            words, and were persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is
            the more excellent way. </div>
         <div>
            Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be
            prestigious, take not this girl away, for the sons of the Achaeans have already
            given her to Achilles; and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for
            no <span class="man">man</span> who by the grace of Zeus wields a scepter has like honor [timê] with Agamemnon. </div>
         <div>
            And Agamemnon answered, "Old sir, all that you
            have said is true, but this <span class="man">man</span> wants to become our lord and master: he must be
            lord of all, king of all, and leader of all, and this shall hardly be. </div>
         <div>
            Order other people about, not me, for I shall
            obey no longer. Furthermore I say - and lay my saying to your heart - I shall
            fight neither you nor any <span class="man">man</span> about this girl, for those that take were those
            also that gave. </div>
         <div>
            they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon
            the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they
            had finished their work [ponos] and the feast was
            ready, they ate it, and every <span class="man">man</span> had his full share, so that all were
            satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, </div>
         <div>
            pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and
            water and handed it round, after giving every <span class="man">man</span> his drink-offering. Thus all
            day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning him and chanting
            the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their voices; </div>
         <div>
            "Hera," replied the sire of gods and men, "you
            must not expect to be informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you
            would find it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there
            is no one, god or <span class="man">man</span>, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a
            matter to myself, </div>
         <div>
            But the heavenly beings were disquieted
            throughout the house of Zeus, till the cunning work<span class="man">man</span> Hephaistos began to try
            and pacify his mother Hera. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you two fall
            to wrangling </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 2</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            if any other <span class="man">man</span> of the Achaeans had told us of
            this dream we should have declared it false, and would have had nothing to do
            with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost <span class="man">man</span> among us; we must therefore
            set about getting the people under arms." With this he led the way from the
            assembly, </div>
         <div>
            and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of
            still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at
            Troy, far from their homes? Go
            about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, <span class="man">man</span> by <span class="man">man</span>, </div>
         <div>
            and speak fairly to them, <span class="man">man</span> by <span class="man">man</span>, that they
            draw not their ships into the sea." Odysseus knew the voice as that of the
            goddess: he flung his cloak from him and set off to run. His squire Eurybates,
            a <span class="man">man</span> of Ithaca, who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, </div>
         <div>
            see to it lest he be angry and do us a
            mischief; for the timê of kings is great, and the
            hand of Zeus is with them." But when he came across some <span class="man">man</span> from some locale
            [dêmos] who was making a noise, he struck him
            with his staff and rebuked him, saying, </div>
         <div>
            "What kind of daimôn has possessed you? Hold your peace, and listen to better men
            than yourself. You are a coward and no warrior; you are nobody either in fight
            or council; we cannot all be kings; it is not well that there should be many
            masters; one <span class="man">man</span> must be supreme - </div>
         <div>
            and all the sea [pontos] is in an uproar. The rest now took their seats and kept to
            their own several places, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled
            tongue - a <span class="man">man</span>of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a
            railer against all who were in authority [kosmos],
            who cared not what he said, </div>
         <div>
            so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh.
            He was the ugliest <span class="man">man</span> of all those that came before Troy - bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with
            his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a
            point, but there was little hair on the top of it. </div>
         <div>
            Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us
            sail home, and leave this <span class="man">man</span> here at Troy to stew in his own prizes of honor, and discover whether
            we were of any service to him or no. Achilles is a much better <span class="man">man</span> than he is,
            and see how he has treated him - </div>
         <div>
            they murmur and would set off homeward. True it
            is that they have had toil [ponos] enough to be disheartened. A <span class="man">man</span> chafes at
            having to stay away from his wife even for a single month, when he is on
            shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, </div>
         <div>
            Nestor, horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene, then addressed
            them. "Shame on you," he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you
            should fight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we
            have taken? </div>
         <div>
            till he has first lain with the wife of some
            Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of
            Helen. Nevertheless, if any <span class="man">man</span> is in such haste to be at home again, let him
            lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. </div>
         <div>
            you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples,
            are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus you
            shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice
            of <span class="man">man</span> that you shall fail to take the town." And Agamemnon answered, </div>
         <div>
            your horses shall steam in front of your
            chariots, and if I see any <span class="man">man</span> shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it
            at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to dogs
            and vultures." Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared approval. As when the
            waves run high </div>
         <div>
            offering sacrifice every <span class="man">man</span> to one or other of
            the gods, and praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the
            fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the
            mighty son of Kronos, and invited the princes and elders of his host. </div>
         <div>
            then, when they had finished their work [ponos] and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every
            <span class="man">man</span> had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had
            enough to eat and drink, Nestor, horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene, began to speak. "King
            Agamemnon," said he, </div>
         <div>
            with sacrifices of bulls and rams. These were
            commanded by Menestheus, son of Peteos. no <span class="man">man</span> living could equal him in the
            marshaling of chariots and foot soldiers. </div>
         <div>
            They robbed him of his divine power of song,
            and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were commanded by
            Nestor, horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene, and with him there came ninety ships. And those
            that held Arcadia, under the high
            mountain of Cyllene, near the tomb of Aipytos, where the people fight hand to
            hand; </div>
         <div>
            The famous spears<span class="man">man</span> Idomeneus led the Cretans,
            who held Knossos, and the
            well-walled city of Gortys; Lyktos
            also, Miletus and Lykastos that lies upon the chalk; the
            populous towns of Phaistos and
            Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. </div>
         <div>
            All these were led by Idomeneus, and by
            Meriones, peer of murderous Ares. And with these there came eighty ships.
            Tlepolemos, son of Herakles, a <span class="man">man</span> both brave and large of stature, brought
            nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. </div>
         <div>
            wherefore the son of Kronos showered down great
            riches upon them. And Nireus brought three ships from Syme - Nireus, who was the handsomest <span class="man">man</span> that
            came up under Ilion of all the Danaans
            after the son of Peleus - </div>
         <div>
            but he was a <span class="man">man</span> of no substance, and had but a
            small following. And those that held Nisyrus, Carpathus, and Casus, with Cos, the city of Eurypylos, and the
            Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippos and Antiphos, two sons of
            King Thessalos the son of Herakles. </div>
         <div>
            Such were the chiefs and princes of the
            Danaans. Who, then, O Muse, was the foremost, whether <span class="man">man</span> or horse, among those
            that followed after the sons of Atreus? Of the horses, those of the son of
            Pheres were by far the finest. They were driven by Eumelos, and were as fleet
            as birds. </div>
         <div>
            and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with
            the voice of Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as
            watch<span class="man">man</span> for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aisyetes, to look out for any sally
            of the Achaeans. </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 3</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist
            upon the mountain tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves,
            and a <span class="man">man</span> can see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust
            from under their feet as they made all speed over the plain. </div>
         <div>
            Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be
            the better <span class="man">man</span> take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but
            let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay
            here in Troy, while the others go
            home to Argos and the land of the
            Achaeans." </div>
         <div>
            They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon
            Hektor spoke. "Hear from my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying
            of Alexander, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and
            Achaeans lay their armor upon the ground, while he and Menelaos fight in the
            midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and
            prove to be the better <span class="man">man</span> take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his
            own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace." </div>
         <div>
            Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace,
            till Menelaos of the loud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear
            me too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of
            Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have
            suffered for my quarrel with Alexander and the wrong he did me. Let him who
            shall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a
            white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for
            Zeus. Moreover, you shall bid mighty Priam come, that he may swear to the
            covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths
            of Zeus must not be transgressed or taken in vain. Young men's minds are light
            as air, but when an old <span class="man">man</span> comes he looks before and after, deeming that which
            shall be fairest upon both sides." </div>
         <div>
            The old <span class="man">man</span> marveled at him and said, "Happy
            son of Atreus, child of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to
            you in great multitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of
            Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river Sangarios; I was their
            ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, but
            even they were not so many as the Achaeans." </div>
         <div>
            The old <span class="man">man</span> next looked upon Odysseus; "Tell
            me," he said, "who is that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader
            across the chest and shoulders? His armor is laid upon the ground, and he
            stalks in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his
            ewes." </div>
         <div>
            And Helen answered, "He is Odysseus, a <span class="man">man</span> of
            great craft, son of Laertes. He
            was born in the district [dêmos] of rugged
            Ithaca, and excels in all manner of
            stratagems and subtle cunning." </div>
         <div>
            On this Antenor said, "my lady, you have spoken
            truly. Odysseus once came here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaos with him.
            I received them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and
            conversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans, Menelaos
            was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Odysseus had the more
            royal presence. After a time they delivered their message, and the speech of
            Menelaos ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a <span class="man">man</span> of
            few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though he was the
            younger <span class="man">man</span> of the two; Odysseus, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was
            at first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor
            graceful movement of his scepter; he kept it straight and stiff like a man
            unpracticed in oratory - one might have taken him for a mere churl or
            simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his
            deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then there was none to touch him,
            and no <span class="man">man</span> thought further of what he looked like." </div>
         <div>
            The old <span class="man">man</span> trembled as he heard, but bade his
            followers yoke the horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the
            chariot, gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him;
            they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they reached the
            ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot, and with measured pace
            advanced into the space between the hosts. </div>
         <div>
            When they had thus armed, each amid his own
            people, they strode fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and
            Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another
            on the measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the
            other. Alexander aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of Atreus,
            but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point. Menelaos next
            took aim, praying to Father Zeus as he did so. "King Zeus," he said, "grant me
            revenge on Alexander who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages
            yet to come a <span class="man">man</span> may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host." </div>
         <div>
            With these words she moved the heart of Helen
            to anger. When she marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom,
            and sparkling eyes, she marveled at her and said, "Goddess, why do you thus
            beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still further to some <span class="man">man</span> whom you
            have taken up in Phrygia or fair
            Meonia? Menelaos has just vanquished Alexander, and is to take my hateful self
            back with him. You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexander yourself;
            henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to
            Olympus; worry about him and look
            after him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave -
            but me? I shall not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word
            among all the women of Troy. Besides,
            I have trouble [akhos] on my mind." </div>
         <div>
            "So you are come from the fight," said she;
            "would that you had fallen rather by the hand of that brave <span class="man">man</span> who was my
            husband. You used to brag that you were a better <span class="man">man</span> with might [biê] of hands and spear than Menelaos. Go, then, and
            challenge him again - but I would advise you not to do so, for if you are
            foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you will soon fall by his spear." </div>

            As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece of
            ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid up in a
            treasure house - many a horse<span class="man">man</span> is fain to bear it, but the king keeps it as
            an ornament [kosmos] of which both horse and driver
            may be proud - even so, O Menelaos, were your shapely thighs and your legs down
            to your fair ankles stained with blood. </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he go about giving his orders among
            the ranks. Passing through the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming
            round Idomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones
            was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when
            he saw him, and spoke him fairly. "Idomeneus," said he, "I treat you with
            greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether in war or in
            other things, or at table. When the princes are mixing my choicest wines in the
            mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed allowance, but your cup is kept
            always full like my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go,
            therefore, into battle, and show yourself the <span class="man">man</span> you have been always proud to
            be." </div>
         <div>
            With this he left them and went onward to
            Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, who was marshaling his men and
            urging them on, in company with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromios, Haimon, and Bias
            shepherd of his people. He placed his horsemen with their chariots and horses
            in the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he could
            trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle, that they might
            fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders to the horsemen first,
            bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid confusion. "Let no
            <span class="man">man</span>," he said, "relying on his strength or horsemanship, get before the others
            and engage singly with the Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will
            weaken your attack; but let each when he meets an enemy's chariot throw his
            spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of old took
            towns and strongholds; in this wise was their thinking [noos]."</div>
         <div>
            Thus did the old <span class="man">man</span> charge them, for he had
            been in many a fight, and King Agamemnon was glad. "I wish," he said to him,
            that your limbs were as supple and your strength [biê] as sure as your judgment is; but age, the common enemy of
            humankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it had fallen upon some
            other, and that you were still young." </div>
         <div>
            And Nestor, horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene, answered, "Son
            of Atreus, I too would gladly be the <span class="man">man</span> I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion;
            but the gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then
            young, and now I am old; </div>
         <div>
            He then left them and went on to others.
            Presently he saw the son of Tydeus, noble Diomedes, standing by his chariot and
            horses, with Sthenelos the son of Kapaneus beside him; whereon he began to
            upbraid him. "Son of Tydeus," he said, "why stand you cowering here upon the
            brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of his men when
            leading them on against the foe - so, at least, say they that saw him in
            battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself. They say that there was no <span class="man">man</span>
            like him. He came once to Mycenae,
            not as an enemy but as a guest, in company with Polyneikes to recruit his
            forces, for they were levying war against the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our people for a body of
            picked men to help them. The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Zeus dissuaded
            them by showing them unfavorable omens [sêmata].
            Tydeus, therefore, and Polyneikes went their way. When they had got as far the
            deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aesepos, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as
            their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet
            in the house of Eteokles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding
            himself single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests of all
            kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily did Athena
            help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty
            youths with two leaders - the godlike hero Maion, son of Haimon, and
            Polyphontes, son of Autophonos - at their head, to lie in wait for him on his
            return journey; but Tydeus slew every <span class="man">man</span> of them, save only Maion, whom he let
            go in obedience to heaven's omens. Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he
            cannot fight as his father did." </div>
         <div>
            As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his
            armor rang so fiercely about his body that even a brave <span class="man">man</span> might well have
            been scared to hear it. </div>
         <div>
            As when some mighty wave that thunders on the
            beach when the west wind has lashed it into fury at sea [pontos]- it has reared its head afar and now comes crashing down on
            the shore; it bows its arching crest high over the jagged rocks and spews its
            salt foam in all directions - even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans
            march steadfastly to battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but
            the men said never a word; no <span class="man">man</span> would think it, for huge as the host was, it
            seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in
            their obedience; and as they marched the armor about their bodies glistened in
            the sun. But the clamor of the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes
            that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and
            bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not
            one speech nor language, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from
            many different places. These were inspired of Ares, but the others by Athena -
            and with them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and
            friend of murderous Ares, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows
            till she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. She it
            was that went about among them and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow
            with even hand between them. </div>
         <div>
            First Antilokhos slew an armed warrior of the
            Trojans, Ekhepolos, son of Thalysios, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck
            at the projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the
            point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong as a
            tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped King Elephenor,
            son of Khalkodon and leader of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of
            reach of the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him of his
            armor. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away,
            and smote him in the side with his bronze-shod spear - for as he stooped his
            side was left unprotected by his shield - and thus he perished. Then the fight
            between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon
            each other like wolves, <span class="man">man</span> and <span class="man">man</span> crushing one upon the other. </div>
         <div>
            And now no <span class="man">man</span> would have made light of the
            fighting if he could have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with
            Athena leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and
            arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side
            face downwards upon the earth.</div>

            Now there was a certain rich and honorable <span class="man">man</span>
            among the Trojans, priest of Hephaistos, and his name was Dares. He had two
            sons, Phegeus and Idaios, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These
            two came forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomedes, he being
            on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to one
            another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomedes ‘s left
            shoulder without hitting him. Diomedes then threw, and his spear sped not in
            vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell from his
            chariot. Idaios did not dare to bestride his brother's body, but sprang from
            the chariot and took to flight, or he would have shared his brother's fate; </div>
         <div>
            The squires [therapontes] of Idomeneus spoiled
            him of his armor, while Menelaos, son of Atreus, killed Skamandrios the son of
            Strophios, a mighty hunts<span class="man">man</span> and keen lover of the chase. Artemis herself had
            taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain
            forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for
            the spear of Menelaos struck him in the back as he was fleeing; it struck him
            between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell
            headlong and his armor rang rattling round him. </div>
         <div>
            Meriones then killed Phereklos the son of
            Tekton, who was the son of Harmon, a <span class="man">man</span> whose hand was skilled in all manner
            of cunning workmanship, for Pallas Athena had dearly loved him. He it was that
            made the ships for Alexander, which were the beginning of all mischief, and
            brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexander himself; for he heeded
            not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was fleeing, and struck
            him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone into the
            bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his
            knees. </div>
         <div>
            And Eurypylos, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor,
            the son of noble Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Skamandros,
            and was honored in the dêmos as though he were a
            god. Eurypylos gave him chase as he was fleeing before him, smote him with his
            sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand
            fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no <span class="man">man</span> can
            withstand, came over his eyes. </div>
         <div>
            Thus furiously did the battle rage between them.
            As for the son of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the
            Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that
            has burst its barrier in full flood; no dikes, no walls of fruitful vineyards
            can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but in a moment it
            comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong <span class="man">man</span> hand
            has reclaimed - even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout
            by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they dared not abide his
            onslaught. </div>
         <div>
            Sthenelos sprang from his chariot, and drew the
            arrow from the wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that
            had been made in his shirt. Then Diomedes prayed, saying, "Hear me, daughter of
            aegis-bearing Zeus, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and stood by
            him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me to come within a
            spear's throw of that <span class="man">man</span> and kill him. He has been too quick for me and has
            wounded me; and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of the sun
            much longer." </div>
         <div>
            Thus he prayed, and Pallas Athena heard him;
            she made his limbs supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went
            up close to him and said, "Fear not, Diomedes, to do battle with the Trojans,
            for I have set in your heart the spirit of your father, the horse<span class="man">man</span> Tydeus.
            Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men
            apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not fight
            him; but should Zeus' daughter Aphrodite come, strike her with your spear and
            wound her." </div>
         <div>
            He killed Astynoos, and shepherd of his people,
            the one with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the
            other with a sword - cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his
            neck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and
            Polyidos, sons of the old <span class="man">man</span> who read [krinô]
            dreams, Eurydamas: they never came back for him to read them any more dreams,
            for mighty Diomedes made an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthos and Thoon, the two sons of
            Phainops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and
            begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomedes took both their
            lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he nevermore saw them come
            home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among
            themselves.</div>
         <div>
            When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the
            ranks, he went through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could
            find Pandaros. When he had found the brave son of Lykaon he said, "Pandaros,
            where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown [kleos] as an archer, in respect of which no <span class="man">man</span> here
            can rival you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Zeus and send
            an arrow at this <span class="man">man</span> who is going so masterfully about, </div>
         <div>
            and has done such deadly work among the
            Trojans. He has killed many a brave <span class="man">man</span> - unless indeed he is some god who is
            angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and has set his hand against
            them in his anger [mênis]." </div>
         <div>
            And the son of Lykaon answered, "Aeneas, I take
            him for none other than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor
            of his helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if
            he is the <span class="man">man</span> I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's
            help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and
            who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him already
            and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breastplate of his
            cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the world below, but it
            seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me.
            Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stables there are
            eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths
            spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses, champing
            barley and rye; my old father Lykaon urged me again and again when I was at
            home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and horses with me that I
            might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have
            been much better if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which
            had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great
            gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot
            to Ilion armed only with my bow and
            arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains,
            the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have
            only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg
            on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilion as a favor [kharis] to
            Hektor, and if ever </div>
         <div>
            Aeneas answered, "Say no more. Things will not
            mend till we two go against this <span class="man">man</span> with chariot and horses and bring him to a
            trial of arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can
            speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Zeus again
            grants glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely back to the city.
            Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight, or
            else do you wait this man's onset while I look after the horses." </div>
         <div>
            They then mounted the chariot and drove
            full-speed towards the son of Tydeus. Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus, saw them
            coming and said to Diomedes, "Diomedes, son of Tydeus, <span class="man">man</span> after my own heart,
            I see two heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a
            skillful archer, Pandaros son of Lykaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is
            Anchises, while his mother is Aphrodite. Mount the chariot and let us retreat.
            Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed." </div>
         <div>
            Diomedes looked angrily at him and answered:
            "Talk not of flight, for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows
            neither flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to
            mount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Athena bids me be afraid
            of no <span class="man">man</span>, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take both
            back again. I say further, </div>
         <div>
            "Bear it, my child," replied Dione, "and make
            the best of it. We dwellers in Olympus
            have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we lay much suffering on one
            another. Ares had to suffer when Otos and Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound
            him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of
            bronze. Ares would have then perished had not fair Eeriboia, stepmother to the
            sons of Aloeus, told Hermes, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh
            worn out by the severity of his bondage. Hera, again, suffered when the mighty
            son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow,
            and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same
            <span class="man">man</span>, the son of aegis-bearing Zeus, hit him with an arrow even at the gates of
            Hades, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the house of Zeus on great
            Olympus, angry and full of pain
            [akhos]; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder
            caused him great anguish till Paieon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on
            the wound, for Hades was not of mortal mold. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who
            recked not of his evil deed in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Athena has egged this son of
            Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no <span class="man">man</span> who
            fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his knees
            when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus see that he does not
            have to fight with one who is stronger than you are. </div>
         <div>
            Then Aeneas killed two champions of the
            Danaans, Crethon and Orsilokhos. Their father was a rich <span class="man">man</span> who lived in the
            strong city of Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad
            stream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilokhos, who
            ruled over many people and was father to Diokles, who in his turn begat twin
            sons, Crethon and Orsilokhos, well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when
            they grew up, went to Ilion with the
            Argive fleet in honor [timê] of Menelaos and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and
            there they both of them reached the final outcome [telos]. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some
            mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they
            get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell
            like high pine-trees to the ground. </div>
         <div>
            Diomedes shook with passion as he saw them. As
            a <span class="man">man</span> crossing a wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some
            great river rolling swiftly to the sea - he sees its boiling waters and starts
            back in fear - even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his
            men, "My friends, how can we wonder that Hektor wields the spear so well? Some
            god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Ares is with him in the
            likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give
            ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods."</div>
         <div>
            As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and
            Hektor killed two men, both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialos, heroes
            well versed in war. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came
            close up and hurled his spear, hitting Amphios the son of Selagus, a <span class="man">man</span> of
            great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much grain-growing land, but his lot
            had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the
            belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the
            ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armor, but the Trojans
            rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel
            upon the body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him
            that he could not strip the goodly armor from his shoulders. The Trojan
            chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so
            that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove him
            from them and he was beaten back.</div>
         <div>
            Thus, then, did the battle rage between them.
            Presently the strong hand of fate impelled Tlepolemos, the son of Herakles, a
            <span class="man">man</span> both brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and
            grandson of great Zeus, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemos spoke first.
            "Sarpedon," said he, "councilor of the Lycians, why should you come skulking
            here you who are a <span class="man">man</span> of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis-bearing
            Zeus, for you are little like those who were of old his children. Far other was
            Herakles, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came here for the horses of
            Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked
            the city of Ilion and made a
            wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are falling from
            you. For all your strength, and all your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but
            will pass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand."</div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile Athena flung her richly embroidered
            vesture, made with her own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the
            shirt of Zeus, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasseled aegis about.
            her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were
            Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there was the
            head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and awful to behold, portent of
            aegis-bearing Zeus. On her head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes,
            and coming to a peak both in front and behind - decked with the emblems of a
            hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the
            spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of
            heroes who have displeased her. Hera lashed the horses on, and the gates of
            heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the
            flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to
            close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found
            the son of Kronos sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Hera stayed her horses, and
            spoke to Zeus the son of Kronos, lord of all. "Father Zeus," said she, "are you
            not angry with Ares for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the
            Achaeans he has destroyed to my great grief [akhos], in violation of the order [kosmos]
            of things, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and
            setting this unrighteous mad<span class="man">man</span> on to keep on doing things that are not right
            [themis]. I hope, Father Zeus, that you will not
            be angry if I hit Ares hard, and chase him out of the battle."</div>
         <div>
            Hera did as he had said. She lashed her horses,
            and they flew forward nothing loath midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a
            <span class="man">man</span> can see when he looks out upon the sea [pontos]
            from some high beacon, so far can the loud-neighing horses of the gods spring
            at a single bound. When they reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simoeis and
            Skamandros meet, there Hera stayed them and took them from the chariot. She hid
            them in a thick cloud, and Simoeis made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the
            two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in their eagerness to help
            the Argives. When they came to the part where the bravest and most in number
            were gathered about mighty Diomedes, fighting like lions or wild boars of great
            strength and endurance, there Hera stood still and raised a shout like that of
            brazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.
            "Argives," she cried; "shame [aidôs] on cowardly
            creatures, brave in semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, his spear
            was so deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian
            gates, but now they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships."</div>
         <div>
            Diomedes answered, "I know you, goddess,
            daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid
            nor out of heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your
            own instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if
            Zeus' daughter Aphrodite came into battle I was to wound her with my spear.
            Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place,
            for I know that Ares is now lording it in the field." "Diomedes, son of
            Tydeus," replied Athena, "<span class="man">man</span> after my own heart, fear neither Ares nor any
            other of the immortals, for I will befriend you. Nay, drive straight at Ares,
            and smite him in close combat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate,
            first on one side and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Hera
            and myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans;
            nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives."</div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 6</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to
            the Achaeans, broke a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his
            comrades by killing Akamas son of Eussoros, the best <span class="man">man</span> among the Thracians,
            being both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting peak of
            his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead into the brain, and
            darkness veiled his eyes.</div>
         <div>
            Then Diomedes killed Axylos son of Teuthranos, a
            rich <span class="man">man</span> who lived in the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men;
            for he had a house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed;
            howbeit not one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomedes
            killed both him and his squire [therapôn] Kalesios,
            who was then his charioteer - so the pair passed beneath the earth.</div>
         <div>
            Thus did he plead, and Menelaos was for yielding
            and giving him to a squire [therapôn] to take to
            the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came running up to him and rebuked
            him. "My good Menelaos," said he, "this is no time for giving quarter. Has,
            then, your house fared so well at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a
            single one of them - not even the child unborn and in its mother's womb; let
            not a <span class="man">man</span> of them be left alive, but let all in Ilion perish, unheeded and forgotten."</div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying,
            "My friends, Danaan warriors, squires [therapontes] of Ares, let no <span class="man">man</span> lag
            that he may spoil the dead, and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill
            as many as we can; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them
            later at your leisure."</div>
         <div>
            Then Glaukos son of Hippolokhos, and the son of
            Tydeus went into the open space between the hosts to fight in single combat.
            When they were close up to one another Diomedes of the loud war-cry was the
            first to speak. "Who, my good sir," said he, "who are you among men? I have
            never seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all others if you
            abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face my might. If, however, you
            are one of the immortals and have come down from heaven, I will not fight you;
            for even valiant Lycurgus, son of Dryas, did not live long when he took to
            fighting with the gods. He it was that drove the nursing women who were in
            charge of frenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as murderous
            Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus himself plunged terror-stricken
            into the sea, and Thetis took him to her bosom to comfort him, for he was
            scared by the fury with which the <span class="man">man</span> reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at
            ease were angry with Lycurgus and the son of Kronos struck him blind, nor did
            he live much longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore I
            will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that eat the fruit
            of the ground, draw near and meet your doom."</div>
         <div>
            Even so is it with the generations of
            humankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then, you would
            learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many. There is a city in the
            heart of Argos, pasture land of
            horses, called Ephyra, where
            Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all humankind. He was the son of
            Aeolus, and had a son named Glaukos, who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven
            endowed with the most surpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his
            ruin, and being stronger than he, drove him from the district [dêmos] of the Argives, over which Zeus had made him
            ruler. For Antaea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would have had him
            lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honorable <span class="man">man</span> and would not, so
            she told lies about him to Proetus. ‘Proetus,’ said she, ‘kill Bellerophon or
            die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.’ The king was
            angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia bearing baneful signs [sêmata], written inside a folded tablet and containing
            much ill against the bearer. He bade Bellerophon show these written signs to
            his father-in-law, to the end that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore
            went to Lycia, and the gods convoyed
            him safely.</div>
         <div>
            Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were
            the peers of men, and as he was returning thence the king devised yet another
            plan for his destruction; he picked [krinô] the
            bravest warriors in all Lycia, and
            placed them in ambuscade, but not a <span class="man">man</span> ever came back, for Bellerophon killed
            every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of
            a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave
            him his daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honor [timê] in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece
            of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to
            have and to hold. </div>
         <div>
            Presently he reached the splendid palace of
            King Priam, adorned with colonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty
            bedchambers - all of hewn stone - built near one another, where the sons of
            Priam slept, each with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the
            courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam's
            daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their
            wives. When Hektor got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodike the
            fairest of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said, "My son,
            why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them,
            pressing you hard about the city that you have thought fit to come and uplift
            your hands to Zeus from the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you
            may make offering to Zeus and to the other immortals, and may then drink and be
            refreshed. Wine gives a <span class="man">man</span> fresh strength when he is wearied, as you now are
            with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen." </div>
         <div>
            to the waves of the roaring sea that should
            have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But, since the gods have
            devised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a better <span class="man">man</span> -
            to one who could smart under dishonor [nemesis] and men's evil speeches. This
            <span class="man">man</span> was never yet to be depended upon, nor never will be, and he will surely
            reap what he has sown. Still, brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it
            is you who bear the brunt of that toil [ponos] that
            has been caused by my hateful self and by the veering [atê] of Alexander - both of whom Zeus has doomed to be a theme of
            song among those that shall be born hereafter." </div>
         <div>
            "My good brother," answered Hektor, you fight
            bravely, and no <span class="man">man</span> with any justice can make light of your doings in battle.
            But you are careless and willfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear
            the ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much toil
            [ponos] on your account. Let us be going, and we
            will make things right hereafter, should Zeus grant us to set the cup of our
            deliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when we have
            chased the Achaeans from Troy."
            
            </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 7</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            Apollo, son of Zeus, replied, "Let us incite
            great Hektor to challenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the
            Achaeans will be shamed into finding a <span class="man">man</span> who will fight him." </div>
         <div>
            Athena assented, and Helenos son of Priam
            divined the counsel of the gods; he therefore went up to Hektor and said,
            "Hektor son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then
            persuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats,
            and challenge the best <span class="man">man</span> among the Achaeans to meet you in single combat. I
            have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of your doom is not
            yet come." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, but they all held their
            peace, ashamed to decline the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last
            Menelaos rose and rebuked them, for he was angry. "Alas," he cried, "vain
            braggarts, women indeed not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us
            if no <span class="man">man</span> of the Danaans will now face Hektor. May you be turned every <span class="man">man</span> of
            you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places. I
            will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of the fight will be from
            on high in the hands of the immortal gods." </div>
         <div>
            With these words he put on his armor; and then,
            O Menelaos, your life would have come to an end at the hands of hands of
            Hektor, for he was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans
            sprung upon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand
            and said, "Menelaos, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of
            passion, do not think of fighting a <span class="man">man</span> so much stronger than yourself as
            Hektor son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.</div>
         <div>
            With these words of reasonable counsel he
            persuaded his brother, whereon his squires [therapontes] gladly stripped the
            armor from off his shoulders. Then Nestor rose and spoke, "For sure," said he,
            "grief [penthos] has befallen the Achaean land. The
            old horse<span class="man">man</span> Peleus, counselor and orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was
            in his house to question me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives.
            How would it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before
            Hektor? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave
            his body and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Zeus, Athena,
            and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the Pylians and
            Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Keladon under the walls of
            Pheia, and round about the waters
            of the river Iardanos. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their
            champion, with the armor of King Areithoos upon his shoulders - Areithoos whom
            men and women had surnamed ‘the Mace-man,’ because he fought neither with bow
            nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus
            killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his
            mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too quick for him and speared him
            through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him
            of the armor which Ares had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but
            when he grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire [therapôn] Ereuthalion, who in this same armor
            challenged the foremost men among us. The others quaked and quailed, but my
            high spirit bade me fight him though none other would venture; I was the
            youngest <span class="man">man</span> of them all;</div>
         <div>
            but when I fought him Athena granted me
            victory. He was the biggest and strongest <span class="man">man</span> that ever I killed, and covered
            much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young
            and strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who
            would face him. But you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none
            of you any stomach for fighting Hektor." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did the old <span class="man">man</span> rebuke them, and forthwith
            nine men started to their feet. Foremost of all stood up King Agamemnon, and
            after him brave Diomedes the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men
            clothed in valor as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his
            brother in arms. After these Eurypylos son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of
            Andraimon, and Odysseus also rose. Then Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene again spoke,
            saying: "Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive out
            of this fight he will have done good service alike to his own soul and to the
            Achaeans." </div>
         <div>
            As they were speaking, Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of
            Gerene shook the helmet, and from it there fell the very lot which they wanted
            - the lot of Ajax. The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains
            of the Achaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.
            When, however, in due course he reached the <span class="man">man</span> who had written upon it and had
            put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him
            the lot. When Ajax saw his mark [sêma] he knew it
            and was glad; he threw it to the ground and said, "My friends, the lot is mine,
            and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hektor. I will put on my armor;</div>
         <div>
            meanwhile, pray to King Zeus in silence among
            yourselves that the Trojans may not hear you - or aloud if you will, for we
            fear no <span class="man">man</span>. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was
            born and bred in Salamis, and can hold
            my own in all things." </div>
         <div>
            With this they fell praying to King Zeus the
            son of Kronos, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of
            heaven, "Father Zeus, you who rule from Ida, most glorious in power, grant
            victory to Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hektor
            also and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess. Thus
            they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze. When he was
            in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Ares when he takes part among men
            whom Zeus has set fighting with one another - even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of
            the Achaeans, spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his
            long spear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but
            the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hektor beat quickly,
            but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had
            been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like a
            wall - a shield of bronze with seven folds of oxhide - the work of Tychios, who
            lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker in leather. He had made it with
            the hides of seven full-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of
            bronze. Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to
            Hektor, and menaced him saying, "Hektor, you shall now learn, <span class="man">man</span> to man, what
            kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted
            Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in anger with
            Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us who are well able to
            face you; therefore begin the fight." </div>
         <div>
            I have been long used to the blood and
            butcheries of battle. I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or
            left, for this I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots
            and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Ares;
            howbeit I would not take such a <span class="man">man</span> as you are off his guard - but I will smite
            you openly if I can." </div>
         <div>
            When they reached the quarters of the son of
            Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honor of Zeus the
            son of Kronos. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into
            joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the
            spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off. When they had
            done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and every <span class="man">man</span> had his
            full and equal share, so that all were satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax
            some slices cut lengthwise down the loin, as a mark of special honor. As soon
            as they had had enough to eat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever
            truest began to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed
            them thus: </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 8</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor
            did the two Ajaxes, squires [therapontes] of Ares, hold their ground. Nestor
            horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene alone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own
            will, but one of his horses was disabled. Alexander husband  of lovely Helen had
            hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins to grow
            away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in his anguish as
            the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw others into confusion. The
            old <span class="man">man</span> instantly began cutting the traces with his sword, but Hektor's fleet
            horses bore down upon him through the rout with their bold charioteer, even
            Hektor himself, and the old <span class="man">man</span> would have perished there and then had not
            Diomedes been quick to mark, and with a loud cry called Odysseus to help him.
            </div>
         <div>
            Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene hearkened to his
            words. Thereon the doughty squires [therapontes],
            Sthenelos and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor's horses, while the two
            both mounted Diomedes' chariot. Nestor took the reins in his hands and lashed
            the horses on; they were soon close up with Hektor, and the son of Tydeus aimed
            a spear at him as he was charging full speed towards them. He missed him, but
            struck his charioteer and squire [therapôn]
            Eniopeus son of noble Thebaios in the breast by the nipple while the reins were
            in his hands, so that he lost his life-breath [psukhê] there and then, and the horses swerved as he fell headlong
            from the chariot. Hektor was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but
            let him lie, despite his sorrow [akhos], while he
            went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds have to go long without
            one, for he presently found brave Arkheptolemos the son of Iphitos, and made
            him get up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand. </div>
         <div>
            All had then been lost and no help for it, for
            they would have been penned up in Ilion like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been quick
            to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just in front of
            Diomedes' horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The horses were frightened
            and tried to back beneath the car, while the reins dropped from Nestor's hands.
            Then he was afraid and said to Diomedes, "Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in
            flight; see you not that the hand of Zeus is against you? To-day he grants
            victory to Hektor; tomorrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to
            ourselves; no <span class="man">man</span>, however brave, may thwart the purpose [noon] of Zeus, for he
            is far stronger than any." </div>
         <div>
            There was no <span class="man">man</span> of all the many Danaans who
            could then boast that he had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth
            to fight sooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he
            slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaos the son of Phradmon. He had
            turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back midway
            between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and his armor rang
            rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot. </div>
         <div>
            After him came Agamemnon and Menelaos, sons of
            Atreus, the two Ajaxes clothed in valor as with a garment, Idomeneus and his
            companion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Ares, and Eurypylos the brave son
            of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under cover of
            the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield Teucer would
            peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, the <span class="man">man</span> would fall dead;
            then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to its mother, and again duck
            down under his shield. </div>
         <div>
            Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first
            kill? Orsilokhos, and then Ormenos and Ophelestes, Daitor, Chromios, and
            godlike Lykophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaimon, and Melanippos. these in turn
            did he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him
            making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,
            "Teucer, <span class="man">man</span> after my own heart, son of Telamon, leader among the host, shoot
            on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory of your father
            Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in his own house when you were
            a child, bastard though you were. Cover him with glory though he is far off; I
            will promise and I will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Zeus and Athena
            grant me to sack the city of Ilion,
            you shall have the next best prize of honor after my own - a tripod, or two
            horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go up into your bed." </div>
         <div>
            they halted at their ships, calling upon one
            another and praying every <span class="man">man</span> instantly as they lifted up their hands to the
            gods; but Hektor wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like
            those of Gorgo or murderous Ares. </div>
         <div>
            Hera when she saw them had pity upon them, and
            at once said to Athena, "Alas, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, shall you and I
            take no more thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever
            do so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a
            single <span class="man">man</span>. Hektor the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and has
            already done great mischief." </div>
         <div>
            Athena answered, "Would, indeed, this <span class="man">man</span> might
            die in his own land, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Zeus
            is mad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets how
            often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labors [athloi] Eurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came
            up to heaven, and then Zeus would send me down to help him; if I had had the
            sense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of Hades, to
            fetch the hell-hound from Erebos, he would never have come back alive out of
            the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Zeus hates me, while he lets Thetis
            have her way because she kissed his knees and took hold of his beard, when she
            was begging him to do honor to Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he
            begins calling me his gray-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go
            within the house of aegis-bearing Zeus and put on my armor; we shall then find
            out whether Priam's son Hektor will be glad to meet us in the highways of
            battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with the fat of
            their flesh as they he dead by the ships of the Achaeans." </div>
         <div>
            bring wine also and grain for your horses and
            gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose flare
            may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to flee beyond the sea by night,
            and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many a <span class="man">man</span> among them must
            take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping
            on board his ship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon the
            Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that the growing
            youths and gray-bearded men are to camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the
            women each of them light a great fire in her house, and let watch be safely
            kept lest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it,
            brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak
            I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to Zeus and to the gods that we may
            then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for ‘tis the fates that have
            borne them and their ships hither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch,
            but with early morning let us put on our armor and rouse fierce war at the
            ships of the Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomedes the son of
            Tydeus will drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself
            slay him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. Tomorrow let him show his
            mettle [aretê], abide my spear if he dare. I ween
            that at break of day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of
            his comrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never
            growing old, and of being worshipped like Athena and Apollo, as I am that this
            day will bring evil to the Argives." </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 9</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            The son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call
            the people to a council <span class="man">man</span> by <span class="man">man</span>, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made
            haste also himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly.
            Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on the side of
            some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke to the Achaeans.
            "My friends," said he, "princes and councilors, Zeus has tied down with ruin
            [atê] more than any other Argive. The cruel god gave me his solemn
            promise that I should sack the city of Troy before returning, but he has played me false, and is now
            bidding me go back to Argos with bad
            kleos and with the loss of many people. Such is
            the will of Zeus, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he will yet lay
            others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say and
            sail back to our own country, for we shall not take Troy." </div>
         <div>
            "Now, however, let us obey the behests of night
            and get our suppers, but let the sentinels every <span class="man">man</span> of them camp by the trench
            that is without the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men; when
            they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your orders, for you
            are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for your councilors; it is
            right and reasonable that you should do so;</div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had
            said. The sentinels went out in their armor under command of Nestor's son
            Thrasymedes, a leader of the host, and of the bold warriors Askalaphos and
            Ialmenos: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyros, and the son of
            Kreion, noble Lykomedes. There were seven leaders of the sentinels, and with
            each there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places
            midway between the trench and the wall, and when they had done so they lit
            their fires and got every <span class="man">man</span> his supper. </div>
         <div>
            "With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king
            of men, Agamemnon, will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king
            over many people. Zeus, moreover, has granted you to wield the scepter and to
            uphold what is right [themis] that you may take
            thought for your people under you; therefore it behooves you above all others
            both to speak and to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have
            been minded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands, therefore I
            will say what I think will be best. no <span class="man">man</span> will be of a truer mind [noos] than that which has been mine from the hour when
            you, sir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against my
            judgment [noos].</div>
         <div>
            And King Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you have
            reproved my folly [atê] justly. I was wrong. I own
            it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself a host, and Zeus has shown that he
            befriends this <span class="man">man</span> by destroying many people of the Achaeans. I was blinded
            with passion and yielded to my worser mind; therefore I will make amends, and
            will give him great gifts by way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence
            of you all. I will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire,
            and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and twelve
            strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich, indeed, both in
            land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my horses have won me. I will
            give him seven excellent workwomen, from Lesbos, whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos - all of
            surpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile
            took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I never
            went up into her couch, nor did I lie down with her, even though it is right
            [themis] for humans, both men and women, to do
            this. </div>
         <div>
            I will add such dower to boot as no <span class="man">man</span> ever
            yet gave his daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,
            Kardamyle, Enope, and Hire,
            where there is grass; holy Pherai
            and the fertile meadows of Anthea;
            Aipeia also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasos, all near the sea, and on the
            borders of sandy Pylos. The men that
            dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honor him with gifts as
            though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable ordinances [themistes]. All this will I do if he will now forgo
            his anger. Let him then yield: it is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and
            unyielding - and hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to humankind.
            Moreover I am older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey
            me." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them
            well. Men-servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages
            filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving
            every <span class="man">man</span> his drink-offering; then, when they had made their offerings, and had
            drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out from the tent of
            Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking first to one and then to another,
            but most especially at Odysseus, was instant with them that they should prevail
            with the noble son of Peleus. </div>
         <div>
            With this he led them forward, and bade them
            sit on seats covered with purple rugs; then he said to Patroklos who was close
            by him, "Son of Menoitios, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water
            with the wine, and give every <span class="man">man</span> his cup, for these are very dear friends, who
            are now under my roof." </div>
         <div>
            "Hail," said he, "Achilles, we have had no
            scant of good cheer, neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has
            been plenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir,
            we are in the face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether we
            shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have camped hard
            by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires throughout their host
            and deem that nothing can now prevent them from falling on our fleet. Zeus,
            moreover, has sent his lightnings on the right side, as signs [sêmata]; Hektor, in all his glory, rages like a
            maniac; confident that Zeus is with him he fears neither god nor <span class="man">man</span>, but is
            gone raving mad, and prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew
            the high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make havoc
            of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke; I much fear that
            heaven will make good his boasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at
            Troy far from our home in
            Argos. Up, then, and late though
            it be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans.
            You will have grief [akhos] hereafter for all time
            to come if you do not, for when the harm is done there will be no cure for it;
            consider ere it be too late, and save the Danaans from destruction. </div>
         <div>
            Rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has
            as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give
            you seven excellent workers, women of Lesbos, whom he chose for himself, when you took Lesbos - all
            of surpassing beauty. He will give you these, and with them her whom he
            erewhile took from you, the daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great
            oath, he has never gone up into her couch nor lain down with her, though it is
            right [themis] for men and women to do so. All
            these things will he give you now down, and if hereafter the gods grant him to
            sack the city of Priam, you can come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil,
            and load your ship with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty
            Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean
            Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he will show
            you like honor with his own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all
            abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodike, and
            Iphianassa; you may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of
            wooing, to the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as no <span class="man">man</span> ever
            yet gave his daughter, and will give you seven well-established cities,
            Kardamyle, Enope, and Hire
            where there is grass; holy Pheras and the fertile meadows of Anthea; Aipeia also, and the vine-clad
            slopes of Pedasos, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in
            cattle and sheep; they will honor you with gifts as though were a god, and be
            obedient to your comfortable ordinances [themistes]. All this will he do if you will now forgo your anger.
            Moreover, though you hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity
            the rest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will
            honor you as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. You might
            even kill Hektor; he will come within your reach, for he is infatuated, and
            declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have brought can hold his own against
            him." </div>
         <div>
            Achilles answered, "Odysseus, noble son of
            Laertes, I should give you
            formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no more of
            this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Hateful [ekhthros] to me like the gates of Hades is the <span class="man">man</span> who
            says one thing while he hides another thing in his mind [phrenes]; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be appeased
            neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the Danaans, for I see
            that I have no thanks [kharis] for all my fighting.
            He that fights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are held
            in equal honor [timê], and death deals like measure
            to him who works and him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships
            - with my life [psukhê] ever at risk; as a bird
            when she has found a morsel takes it to her nestlings, and herself fares
            hardly, even so many a long night have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle
            have I waged by day against those who were fighting for their women. With my
            ships I have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed with my men by land; I
            took great store of wealth from every one of them, but I gave all up to
            Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where he was by his ships, yet of what came
            to him he gave little, and kept much himself. </div>
         <div>
            "Nevertheless he did distribute some prizes of
            honor among the chieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone
            of the Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted - let him keep her
            and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans? What
            made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them? Was it not for the sake
            of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the world who love their
            wives? Any <span class="man">man</span> of common right feeling will love and cherish her who is his
            own, as I this woman, with my whole heart, though she was but a fruitling of my
            spear. Agamemnon has taken her from me; he has played me false; I know him; let
            him tempt me no further, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you,
            Odysseus, and to the other princes to save his ships from burning.</div>
         <div>
            he may offer me gifts as the sands of the sea
            or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so he shall not move me till I
            have been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. I will not
            marry his daughter; she may be fair as Aphrodite, and skillful as Athena, but I
            will have none of her: let another take her, who may be a good match for her
            and who rules a larger kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus
            will find me a wife; there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia,
            daughters of kings that have cities under them; of these I can take whom I will
            and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo and wed a woman who would
            make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My
            life [psukhê] means more to me than all the wealth
            of Ilion while it was yet at peace
            before the Achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the stone
            floor of Apollo's temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep are to be had for harrying, and a <span class="man">man</span>
            buy both tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his life has once left
            him it can neither be bought nor harried back again. </div>
         <div>
            "It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you;
            I loved you with all my heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you
            had gone out elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the
            dainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your lips. Many a
            time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness over my shirt; I had
            infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven had granted me no offspring
            of my own, and I made a son of you, Achilles, that in my hour of need you might
            protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish
            not your anger for ever; the excellence [aretê] and
            might [biê] and honor [timê] of the gods are more than ours, but even gods may be appeased;
            and if a <span class="man">man</span> has erred he prays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his
            piteous cries and by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savor of burnt
            sacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to great Zeus; halt, wrinkled, with
            eyes askance, they follow in the footsteps of Derangement [Atê], who, being fierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind
            him, and ever baneful to humankind outstrips them even to the ends of the
            world; but nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a <span class="man">man</span>
            has pity upon these daughters of Zeus when they draw near him, they will bless
            him and hear him too when he is praying; but if he deny them and will not
            listen to them, they go to Zeus the son of Kronos and pray that he may
            presently fall into derangement [atê] - to his
            ruing bitterly hereafter.</div>
         <div>
            "I totally recall [memnêmai] this event of the past - it is not a new thing - and how
            it happened. You are all near and dear [philoi],
            and I will tell it in your presence. The Curetes and the Aetolians were
            fighting and killing one another round Calydon - the Aetolians defending the
            city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Artemis of the golden throne was
            angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his harvest
            first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to the
            daughter of great Zeus alone he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or
            somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous derangement.
            Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature
            against him - a savage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm to
            his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the
            ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities and
            killed it - for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and many a <span class="man">man</span>
            did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the goddess set the Curetes and
            the Aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin of the boar. "So long
            as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the Curetes, and for all
            their numbers they could not hold their ground under the city walls; but in the
            course of time the anger weighed heavy on the thinking [noos] of Meleager : this can sometimes happen even to a sensible
            man.</div>
         <div>
            He was incensed with his mother Althaia, and
            therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair Cleopatra, who was daughter
            of Marpessa daughter of Euenos, and of Ides the <span class="man">man</span> then living. He it was who
            took his bow and faced King Apollo himself for fair Marpessa's sake; her father
            and mother then named her Halcyone, because her mother had mourned with the
            strains of the halcyon, bird of much grief [penthos], when Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then,
            stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of his
            mother's curses. His mother, grieving for the death of her brother, prayed the
            gods, and beat the earth with her hands, calling upon Hades and on awful
            Persephone; she went down upon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as
            she prayed that they would kill her son - and Erinys that walks in darkness and
            knows no ruth heard her from Erebos. </div>
         <div>
            On this they took every <span class="man">man</span> his double cup,
            made their drink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Odysseus leading the
            way. But Patroklos told his men and the maid-servants to make ready a
            comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and
            a sheet of fine linen. The old <span class="man">man</span> then laid himself down and waited till
            morning came. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughter
            of Phorbas lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroklos lay on the other side of the
            room, and with him fair Iphis whom Achilles had given him when he took
            Skyros the city of Enyeus. </div>
         <div>
            Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains
            approved his words. They then made their drink-offerings and went every <span class="man">man</span> to
            his own tent, where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of
            sleep.
            </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 10</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            And King Agamemnon answered, "Menelaos, we both
            of us need shrewd counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Zeus has
            changed his mind, and inclines towards Hektor's sacrifices rather than ours. I
            never saw nor heard tell of any <span class="man">man</span> as having wrought such ruin in one day as
            Hektor has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans - and that too of his
            own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will
            rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the
            ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus. Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him
            rise and go about among the companies of our sentinels to give them their
            instructions; they will listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son,
            and Meriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are leaders over them. It was to
            them more particularly that we gave this charge." </div>
         <div>
            Menelaos replied, "How do I take your meaning?
            Am I to stay with them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as
            I have given your orders?" "Wait," answered King Agamemnon, "for there are so
            many paths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every <span class="man">man</span> on
            your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by his father's
            name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too much upon your own
            dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth Zeus laid this
            heavy burden upon us." </div>
         <div>
            With these instructions he sent his brother on
            his way, and went on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in
            his tent hard by his own ship; his goodly armor lay beside him - his shield,
            his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming belt with which
            the old <span class="man">man</span> girded himself when he armed to lead his people into battle - for
            his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and looked up at
            Agamemnon. "Who is it," said he, "that goes thus about the host and the ships
            alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping? Are you looking for one
            of your mules or for some comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but
            speak. What is your business?" </div>
         <div>
            With this he put on his shirt, and bound his
            sandals about his comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two
            thicknesses, large, and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable
            bronze-shod spear, and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships.
            First he called loudly to Odysseus peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he
            was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and
            said, "Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of the ships
            in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so urgent?" And Nestor
            horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene answered, "Odysseus, noble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the
            Achaeans are in great sorrow [akhos]. Come with me
            and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether we shall fight
            or flee." </div>
         <div>
            And Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene made answer, "My
            son, all that you have said is true. I have good sons, and also many people who
            might call the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and
            death are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are
            younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet son of Phyleus."
            </div>
         <div>
            Diomedes threw the skin of a great tawny lion
            about his shoulders - a skin that reached his feet - and grasped his spear.
            When he had roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went
            the round of those who were on guard, and found the leaders not sleeping at
            their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep dogs
            that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast coming
            through the mountain forest towards them - forthwith there is a hue and cry of
            dogs and men, and slumber is broken - even so was sleep chased from the eyes of
            the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turned
            constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans.
            The old <span class="man">man</span> was glad bade them be of good cheer. "Watch on, my children," said
            he, "and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us." </div>
         <div>
            Nestor spoke first. "My friends," said he, "is
            there any <span class="man">man</span> bold enough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler,
            or us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the
            ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans,
            they will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this and come back
            safely here, his fame [kleos] would be high as
            heaven in the mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the
            chiefs from all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb
            - which is a present of surpassing value - and he would be asked as a guest to
            all feasts and clan-gatherings." </div>
         <div>
            They all held their peace, but Diomedes of the
            loud war-cry spoke saying, "Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans
            over against us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater
            confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some
            opportunity [kerdos] which the other has not caught
            sight of; if a <span class="man">man</span> is alone he is less full of resource, and his wit [noos] is weaker." </div>
         <div>
            On this several offered to go with Diomedes.
            The two Ajaxes, squires [therapontes] of Ares,
            Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaos son of
            Atreus; Odysseus also wished to go among the host of the Trojans, for he was
            ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke thus: "Diomedes,"
            said he, "son of Tydeus, <span class="man">man</span> after my own heart, choose your comrade for
            yourself - take the best <span class="man">man</span> of those that have offered, for many would now go
            with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst out
            of respect [aidôs] for his lineage, because he is
            of more royal blood." </div>
         <div>
            He said this because he feared for Menelaos.
            Diomedes answered, "If you bid me take the <span class="man">man</span> of my own choice, how in that
            case can I fail to think of Odysseus, than whom there is no <span class="man">man</span> more eager to
            face all kinds of danger [ponoi] - and Pallas
            Athena loves him well? If he were to go with me we should pass safely through
            fire itself, for he is quick to see and understand." </div>
         <div>
            They all held their peace; but there was among
            the Trojans a certain <span class="man">man</span> named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald - a
            <span class="man">man</span> rich in gold and bronze. He was ill-favored, but a good runner, and was an
            only son among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans. "I,
            Hektor," said he, "Will to the ships and will exploit them. But first hold up
            your scepter and swear that you will give me the chariot, equipped with bronze,
            and the horses that now carry the noble son of Peleus. I will make you a good
            scout, and will not fail you. I will go through the host from one end to the
            other till I come to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the
            Achaeans are now consulting whether they shall fight or flee." </div>
         <div>
            Odysseus smiled at him and answered, "You had
            indeed set your heart upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of
            Aiakos are hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal <span class="man">man</span> than
            Achilles himself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,
            where did you leave Hektor when you started? Where lies his armor and his
            horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered?
            What are their plans? Will they stay here by the ships and away from the city,
            or now that they have worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their
            walls?" </div>
         <div>
            with the Phrygians and Meonians, have their
            place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask about an this? If you want to
            find your way into the host of the Trojans, there are the Thracians, who have
            lately come here and lie apart from the others at the far end of the camp; and
            they have Rhesus son of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and
            strongest that I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any
            wind that blows. His chariot is equipped with silver and gold, and he has
            brought his marvelous golden armor, of the rarest workmanship - too splendid
            for any mortal <span class="man">man</span> to carry, and meet only for the gods. Now, therefore, take
            me to the ships or bind me securely here, until you come back and have proved
            my words whether they be false or true." </div>
         <div>
            With these words he took the spoils and set
            them upon a tamarisk tree, and they made a mark [sêma] at the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs of
            tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the fleeing
            hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen armor and the
            blood, and came presently to the company of Thracian warriors, who were
            sleeping, tired out with their day's toil; their goodly armor was lying on the
            ground beside them all in order [kosmos], in three
            rows, and each <span class="man">man</span> had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in
            the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his
            chariot. Odysseus from some way off saw him and said, "This, Diomedes, is the
            man, and these are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your
            very utmost; dally not about your armor, but loose the horses at once - or else
            kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses." </div>
         <div>
            He had hardly done speaking when the two men
            came in and dismounted, whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them
            and congratulated them. Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene was first to question them.
            "Tell me," said he, "renowned Odysseus, how did you two come by these horses?
            Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give
            them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the Trojans, for
            old warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or
            heard of such horses as these are. Surely some god must have met you and given
            them to you, for you are both of dear to Zeus, and to Zeus' daughter Athena." </div>
         <div>
            And Odysseus answered, "Nestor son of Neleus,
            honor to the Achaean name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better
            horses than these, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses,
            however, about which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomedes killed their king with the
            twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth <span class="man">man</span> -
            a scout whom Hektor and the other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships." </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 11</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            every <span class="man">man</span> now left his horses in charge of his
            charioteer to hold them in proper order [kosmos] by
            the trench, while he went into battle on foot clad in full armor, and a mighty
            uproar rose on high into the dawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench
            before the horses got there, but these came up presently. The son of Kronos
            sent a portent of evil sound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood,
            for he was about to send many a brave <span class="man">man</span> hurrying down to Hades. </div>
         <div>
            Now so long as the day waxed and it was still
            morning, their darts rained thick on one another and the people perished, but
            as the hour drew nigh when a woods<span class="man">man</span> working in some mountain forest will get
            his midday meal - for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is tired out,
            and must now have food - then the Danaans, by force of their striving [aretê], broke the battalions of the enemy with a cry
            that rang through all their ranks. Agamemnon led them on, and slew first
            Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer
            Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and was coming full towards him; but
            Agamemnon struck him on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no
            avail against the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his
            brains were battered in and he was killed in full fight. </div>
         <div>
            Agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them
            and left them with their breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then
            went on to kill Isos and Antiphos two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the
            other born in wedlock; they were in the same chariot - the bastard driving,
            while noble Antiphos fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both of them
            prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withies as they
            were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon
            son of Atreus smote Isos in the chest above the nipple with his spear, while he
            struck Antiphos hard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he
            stripped their goodly armor from off them and recognized them, for he had
            already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion
            fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing them
            of their tender life while he on his way back to his lair - the hind can do
            nothing for them even though she be close by, for she is in an agony of fear,
            and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before
            the mighty monster - so, no <span class="man">man</span> of the Trojans could help Isos and Antiphos,
            for they were themselves fleeing panic before the Argives. </div>
         <div>
            Tell me now you Muses that dwell in the
            mansions of Olympus, who, whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first
            to face Agamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a <span class="man">man</span> both brave and of
            great stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. Kissês, his mother's father,
            brought him up in his own house when he was a child - Kissês, father to fair
            Theano. When he reached manhood, Kissês would have kept him there, and was for
            giving him his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had married, he went
            away from the bride chamber, looking for glory [kleos] from the Achaeans. He came with twelve ships: these he had
            left at Perkote and had come on by land to Ilion. He it was that now met Agamemnon son of Atreus. When
            they were close up with one another, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and
            Iphidamas hit him on the belt below the cuirass and then flung himself upon
            him, trusting to his strength of arm; the belt, however, was not pierced, nor
            nearly so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver and was turned
            aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand, and
            drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his sword, and killed
            Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there the poor young <span class="man">man</span> lay,
            sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in the defense of his
            fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy [kharis] though he had given much for her: he had given
            a hundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give a thousand
            sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which he was possessed.
            Agamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and carried off his armor into the
            host of the Achaeans. </div>
         <div>
            When Hektor saw Agamemnon quit the field, he
            shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian
            warriors, be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their
            best <span class="man">man</span> has left them, and Zeus has granted me a great triumph; charge the foe
            with your chariots that. you may win still greater glory." </div>
         <div>
            Diomedes all undaunted answered, "Archer, you
            who without your bow are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be
            tried in single combat fighting in full armor, your bow and your arrows would
            serve you in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the
            sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had hit me. A
            worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound a <span class="man">man</span> though I but
            graze his skin it is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low.</div>
         <div>
            So saying he drew Sokos' heavy spear out of his
            flesh and from his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was
            withdrawn so that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Odysseus was
            bleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he
            therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him. Thrice did
            he cry as loudly as <span class="man">man</span> can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaos hear him; he
            turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and said, "Ajax, noble son
            of Telamon, leader of your people, the cry of Odysseus rings in my ears, as
            though the Trojans had cut him off and were worsting him while he is
            single-handed. Let us make our way through the throng; it will be well that we
            defend him; I fear he may come to harm for all his valor if he be left without
            support, and the Danaans would miss him sorely." </div>
         <div>
            Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene did as Idomeneus had
            counseled; he at once mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed
            physician Asklepios went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward
            nothing loath towards the ships, as though of their own free will. </div>
         <div>
            With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when
            they felt the whip they drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and
            Trojans, over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was
            bespattered with blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes
            both from the horses' hoofs and from the tires of the wheels. Hektor tore his
            way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence
            threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long idle; nevertheless
            though he went among the ranks with sword and spear, and throwing great stones,
            he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for Zeus would have been angry with him if he
            had fought a better <span class="man">man</span> than himself. </div>
         <div>
            Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming
            fire. Meanwhile the mares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing
            Nestor out of the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles
            saw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching the
            hard stress [ponos] and struggle of the fight. He
            called from the ship to his comrade Patroklos, who heard him in the tent and
            came out looking like Ares himself - here indeed was the beginning of the ill
            that presently befell him. "Why," said he, "Achilles do you call me? what do
            you what do you want with me?" And Achilles answered, "Noble son of Menoitios,
            <span class="man">man</span> after my own heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at
            my knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroklos, and ask Nestor who is
            that he is bearing away wounded from the field; from his back I should say it
            was Machaon son of Asklepios, but I could not see his face for the horses went
            by me at full speed." </div>
         <div>
            on it there was a vessel of bronze and an onion
            to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was
            also a cup of rare workmanship which the old <span class="man">man</span> had brought with him from
            home, studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which there
            were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else
            would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full, but
            Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed
            them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat's milk cheese into it with a
            bronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus
            prepared the mess she bade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus
            quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at this moment
            Patroklos appeared at the door. </div>
         <div>
            When the old <span class="man">man</span> saw him he sprang from his
            seat, seized his hand, led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among
            them; but Patroklos stood where he was and said, "Noble sir, I may not stay,
            you cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be trifled
            with, and he bade me ask who the wounded <span class="man">man</span> was whom you were bearing away
            from the field. I can now see for myself that he is Machaon shepherd of his
            people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You, sir, know what a terrible <span class="man">man</span> he
            is, and how ready to blame even where no blame should lie." </div>
         <div>
            And Nestor answered, "Why should Achilles care
            to know how many of the Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the grief
            [penthos] that reigns in our host; our most
            valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomedes son of Tydeus is wounded; so
            are Odysseus and Agamemnon; Eurypylos has been hit with an arrow in the thigh,
            and I have just been bringing this <span class="man">man</span> from the field - he too wounded - with
            an arrow; nevertheless Achilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows
            no ruth. Will he wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we
            perish one upon the other?</div>
         <div>
            As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me
            any longer; would that I were still young and strong as in the days when there
            was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then killed Itymoneus the
            valiant son of Hypeirochos a dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart
            thrown my hand while fighting in the front rank in defense of his cows, so he
            fell and the country people around him were in great fear. We drove off a vast
            quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle and as many flocks of
            sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many wide-spreading flocks of goats.
            Of horses moreover we seized a hundred and fifty, all of them mares, and many
            had foals running with them. All these did we drive by night to Pylos the city of Neleus, taking them within
            the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had taken so much, though
            it was the first time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak the heralds
            went round crying that all in Elis to
            whom there was a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to
            divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men
            of Pylos were few and had been
            oppressed with wrong; in former years Herakles had come, and had laid his hand
            heavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus had had twelve
            sons, but I alone was left; the others had all been killed. The Epeans
            presuming upon all this had looked down upon us and had done us much evil. My
            father chose [krinô] a herd of cattle and a great
            flock of sheep - three hundred in all - and he took their shepherds with him,
            for there was a great debt due to him in Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their
            chariots with them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King
            Augeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the loss of his
            horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done, and took great
            value in return, but he gave the rest to the people of the district [dêmos] to divide among themselves, so that no <span class="man">man</span>
            might have less than his full share. </div>
         <div>
            "The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were
            determined to take it, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in
            store for them. When the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joined
            battle, praying to Zeus and to Athena, and when the fight had begun, I was the
            first to kill my <span class="man">man</span> and take his horses - to wit the warrior Moulios. He was
            son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired
            Agamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the
            earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me,</div>
         <div>
            and when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprang
            upon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all
            directions when they saw the leader of their horsemen (the best <span class="man">man</span> they had)
            laid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty chariots -
            and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear. I should have even
            killed the two Moliones sons of Aktor, unless their real father, Poseidon lord
            of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out of the
            fight. Thereon Zeus granted the Pylians a great victory, for we chased them far
            over the plain, killing the men and bringing in their armor, till we had
            brought our horses to Bouprasion rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with
            the hill that is called Alision, at which point Athena turned the people back.
            There I slew the last <span class="man">man</span> and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses
            back from Bouprasion to Pylos and
            gave thanks to Zeus among the gods, and among mortal men to Nestor. </div>

            "Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever
            was, but Achilles is for keeping all his valor [aretê] for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter when the host
            is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoitios charge you thus, on
            the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon? Odysseus and I were in the house, inside,
            and heard all that he said to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus
            while beating up recruits throughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoitios and yourself,
            and Achilles with you. The old horse<span class="man">man</span> Peleus was in the outer court, roasting
            the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Zeus the lord of thunder; and he held a gold
            chalice in his hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine over the
            burning sacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment
            we stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand
            into the house, placed us at table, and set before us such hospitable
            entertainment as is right [themis] for guests to
            expect.</div>
         <div>
            When we had satisfied ourselves with meat and
            drink, I said my say and urged both of you to join us. You were ready enough to
            do so, and the two old men charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his
            son Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers, while
            Menoitios the son of Aktor spoke thus to you: ‘My son,’ said he, ‘Achilles is
            of nobler birth than you are, but you are older than he, though he is far the
            better <span class="man">man</span> of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he
            will follow you to his own profit.’ Thus did your father charge you, but you
            have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he will
            listen to you. Who knows but with the help of a daimôn you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend's
            advice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told
            him something from Zeus, then let him send you, and let the rest of the
            Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance you may bring light and saving to the
            Danaans. And let him send you into battle clad in his own armor, that the
            Trojans may mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the
            Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they are hard pressed and
            there is little breathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily
            drive a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships." </div>

            I would myself gladly see them perish now and
            here far from Argos; but if they
            should rally and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench
            there will be not so much as a <span class="man">man</span> get back to the city to tell the tale. Now,
            therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires [therapontes] hold our horses by the trench, but let us follow Hektor
            in a body on foot, clad in full armor, and if the day of their doom is at hand
            the Achaeans will not be able to withstand us." </div>
         <div>
            Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased
            Hektor, who sprang in full armor to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when
            they saw him do so, also left their chariots. each <span class="man">man</span> then gave his horses
            over to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready, in proper order [kosmos], for him at the trench. Then they formed
            themselves into companies, made themselves ready, and in five bodies followed
            their leaders. Those that went with Hektor and Polydamas were the bravest and
            most in number, and the most determined to break through the wall and fight at
            the ships. Kebriones was also joined with them as third in command, for Hektor
            had left his chariot in charge of a less valiant warrior. The next company was
            led by Paris, Alkathoos, and Agenor;
            the third by Helenos and Deiphobos, two sons of Priam, and with them was the
            hero Asios - Asios the son of Hyrtakos, whose great black horses of the breed
            that comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas the
            valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor,
            Arkhelokhos and Akamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon was
            leader over the allies, and took with him Glaukos and Asteropaios whom he
            deemed most valiant after himself - for he was far the best <span class="man">man</span> of them all.
            These helped to array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged
            straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure that they would not hold out longer
            and that they should themselves now fall upon the ships. </div>
         <div>
            even though by a mighty effort we break through
            the gates and wall of the Achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall
            not return in good order [kosmos] by the way we
            came, but shall leave many a <span class="man">man</span> behind us whom the Achaeans will do to death
            in defense of their ships. Thus would any seer who was expert in these matters,
            and was trusted by the people, read the portent." </div>
         <div>
            Hektor looked fiercely at him and said,
            "Polydamas, I like not of your reading. You can find a better saying than this
            if you will. If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has
            heaven robbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels
            of Zeus, nor to the promises he made me - and he bowed his head in
            confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl. What care
            I whether they flee towards dawn or dark, and whether they be on my right hand
            or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in the counsel of great Zeus, king
            of mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one only - that a <span class="man">man</span> should
            fight for his country. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at
            the ships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are
            not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would talk others over
            from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my spear." </div>
         <div>
            this he held in front of him, and brandishing
            his two spears came on like some lion of the wilderness, who has been long
            famished for want of meat and will dare break even into a well-fenced homestead
            to try and get at the sheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their
            flocks with dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the fold
            till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it
            off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand - even so was Sarpedon fain to
            attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to Glaukos son of
            Hippolokhos, "Glaukos, why in Lycia do
            we receive especial honor as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest
            portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us as
            though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks of the river
            Xanthos, fair with orchard
            lawns and wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at
            the head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that one may say
            to another, Our princes in Lycia eat
            the fat of the land and drink best of wine, but they are fine men; they fight
            well and are ever at the front in battle.’ My good friend, if, when we were
            once out of this fight, we could escape old age and death thenceforward and for
            ever, I should neither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten
            thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads, and no <span class="man">man</span> can elude him; therefore
            let us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another." </div>

         <div>
            if you fight not with might and main, this very
            day will see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great and
            terrible portent which I had never thought to see - the Trojans at our ships -
            they, who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and
            wolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight for they cannot defend
            themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of
            the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at
            our very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection of the
            people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight in defense of the
            ships but are being slaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus
            is responsible [aitios] for our disaster by having
            insulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should leave off
            fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal quickly.
            You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest warriors in our whole
            army. I blame no <span class="man">man</span> for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I am
            indignant with such men as you are. My good friends, matters will soon become
            even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, of his own respect
            [aidôs] and sense of nemesis, for the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hektor is now
            fighting at our ships; he has broken through the gates and the strong bolt that
            held them." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did the earth-encircler address the
            Achaeans and urge them on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong
            bands of men, of whom not even Ares nor Athena, marshaler of hosts could make
            light if they went among them, for they were the picked [krinô] men of all those who were now awaiting the onset of Hektor
            and the Trojans. They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield,
            buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and <span class="man">man</span> to <span class="man">man</span>. The horse-hair crests on
            their gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely
            locked in battle were they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands
            were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle. </div>
         <div>
            The others continued fighting, and the cry of
            battle rose up into the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill
            his man, to wit, the warrior Imbrios son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the
            Achaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesikaste a bastard
            daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he had gone back to
            Ilion, and was a great <span class="man">man</span> among
            the Trojans, dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honor with his own
            sons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear which he
            then drew back again, and Imbrios fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is
            felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green
            foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his
            bronze-equipped armor ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with
            intent to strip him of his armor; but as he was doing so, Hektor took aim at
            him with a spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit
            Amphimakhos, son of Kteatos son of Aktor, in the chest as he was coming into
            battle, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
            Hektor sprang forward to take Amphimakhos' helmet from off his temples, and in
            a moment Ajax threw a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased
            all over in his terrible armor; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his
            shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses, which the
            Achaeans then drew off. Stichios and Menestheus, leaders of the Athenians, bore
            away Amphimakhos to the host of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous
            Ajaxes did the like by Imbrios. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that
            have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the
            ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrios, and
            strip it of its armor. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from the neck in
            revenge for the death of Amphimakhos, and sent it whirling over the crowd as
            though it had been a ball, till fell in the dust at Hektor's feet. </div>
         <div>
            Idomeneus answered, "I know you for a <span class="man">man</span> of
            excellence [aretê]: you need not tell me. If the
            best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush- and there is
            nothing like this for showing what a <span class="man">man</span> is made of; it comes out then who is
            cowardly and who has a sense of striving [aretê];
            the coward will change color at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and
            keeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart
            beats fast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his teeth;
            whereas the brave <span class="man">man</span> will not change color nor be on finding himself in
            ambush, but is all the time longing to go into action </div>
         <div>
            Idomeneus answered, "There are others to defend
            the center - the two Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the
            Achaeans, and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hektor son
            of Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish their
            indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Kronos fling a
            firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will yield to
            no <span class="man">man</span> who is in mortal mold and eats the grain of Demeter , if bronze and
            great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to Achilles in
            hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is none to beat him; let us
            turn therefore towards the left wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are
            to give glory to some other, or he to us." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung
            with grief [akhos] over what he said. Noble
            Antilokhos was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him forget his
            friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and covered him with his
            shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mekisteus son of Echios, and Alastor
            stooped down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus
            ceased not his fury. He kept on striving continually either to enshroud some
            Trojan in the darkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil
            day from the Achaeans. Then fell Alkathoos son of noble Aisyetes: he was
            son-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia who was
            the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation in
            beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest <span class="man">man</span> in all
            Troy had taken her to wife - him
            did Poseidon lay low by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and
            binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one
            side, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck him
            with a spear in the middle of his chest.</div>
         <div>
            The coat of mail that had hitherto protected
            his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear tore through it. He fell
            heavily to the ground, and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and
            made the butt-end of the spear quiver till dread Ares put an end to his life.
            Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, "Deiphobos,
            since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed
            three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, that you may
            learn what manner of Zeus-begotten <span class="man">man</span> am I that have come hither. Zeus first
            begot Minos chief ruler in Crete, and
            Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deukalion; Deukalion begot me to be a
            ruler over many men in Crete, and my
            ships have now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, your father, and
            the Trojans." </div>
         <div>
            On this, all of them as one <span class="man">man</span> stood near him,
            shield on shoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking
            towards Deiphobos, Paris, and Agenor,
            who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself, and the people followed
            them as sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have been
            feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad - even so was the heart of
            Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him. </div>
         <div>
            who will one day destroy your city; you stole
            my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest,
            and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A day will
            come when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O father Zeus, you, who they
            say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things that
            befall us do proceed, how can you thus favor the Trojans - men so proud and
            overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All things pall after a
            while - sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance - still these are things of
            which a <span class="man">man</span> would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of
            battle that the Trojans are insatiate." </div>
         <div>
            
            Paris was deeply grieved by the death
            of Harpalion, who was his host when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed
            an arrow, therefore, in order to avenge him. Now there was a certain <span class="man">man</span> named
            Euchenor, son of Polyidos the seer [mantis], a
            brave <span class="man">man</span> and wealthy, whose home was in Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it would be the death
            of him, for his good old father Polyidos had often told him that he must either
            stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish
            at the hands of the Trojans; he chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy
            fine the Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the
            pain and suffering of disease. Paris
            now smote him on the jaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he
            was enshrouded in the darkness of death. </div>
         <div>
            Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming
            fire. But Hektor had not yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were
            making havoc of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere
            long would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Poseidon cheer them on
            and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first forced his
            way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through the serried ranks of
            Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax and Protesilaos were drawn
            up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at its lowest, and the fight both of <span class="man">man</span>
            and horse raged most fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long
            tunics, the Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans
            could hardly stay Hektor as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could they
            drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen men of the
            Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos, with whom were also
            Pheidas, Stichios, and stalwart Bias: Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and
            Drakios commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarkes led the men of
            Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he
            lived in Phylake away from his own country, for he had killed the brother of
            his stepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarkes, was the son of
            Iphiklos son of Phylakos. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and
            defended the ships along with the Boeotians. </div>
         <div>
            The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry
            plight from the ships and tents back to windy Ilion, had not Polydamas presently said to Hektor, "Hektor,
            there is no persuading you to take advice. Because heaven has so richly endowed
            you with the arts of war, you think that you must therefore excel others in
            counsel; but you cannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has made
            one <span class="man">man</span> an excellent warrior; of another it has made a dancer or a singer and
            player on the lyre; while yet in another Zeus has implanted a wise
            understanding [noos] of which men reap fruit to the
            saving of many, and he himself knows more about it than any one; therefore I
            will say what I think will be best. The fight has hemmed you in as with a
            circle of fire,</div>
         <div>
            Alexander answered, "Hektor, why find fault
            when there is no one to find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any
            day rather than this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about
            me. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we have been
            staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades about whom you ask
            me are dead; Deiphobos and King Helenos alone have left the field, wounded both
            of them in the hand, but the son of Kronos saved them alive. Now, therefore,
            lead on where you would have us go, and we will follow with right goodwill; you
            shall not find us fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no <span class="man">man</span> can
            do more than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be." </div>

            As he spoke he took up the shield of his son
            Thrasymedes that was lying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for
            Thrasymedes had taken his father's shield; he grasped his redoubtable
            bronze-shod spear, and as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the
            Achaeans who, now that their wall was overthrown, were fleeing pell-mell before
            the Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves are
            dumb - they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the fierce
            winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set neither this
            way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down from heaven to determine
            [krinô] them - even so did the old <span class="man">man</span> ponder
            whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the
            end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts were
            fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled on their bodies,
            as they thrust at one another with their swords and spears. </div>
         <div>
            Then Nestor horse<span class="man">man</span> of Gerene answered, "It is
            indeed as you say; it is all coming true at this moment, and even Zeus who
            thunders from on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied
            as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are fighting
            stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may you cannot see
            from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they are being killed in
            a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel
            [noos] can be of any use, what we had better do;
            but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for a <span class="man">man</span> cannot fight
            when he is wounded." </div>
         <div>
            And King Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, if the
            Trojans are indeed fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor
            the trench has served us - over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which
            they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet - I see
            it must be the will of Zeus that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here,
            far from Argos. I knew when Zeus was
            willing to defend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to like
            honor with the gods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand and foot.
            Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships that are on
            the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them fast to their
            mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night - if even by night
            the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then draw down the rest of the
            fleet. There is no sense of nemesis in fleeing ruin
            even by night. It is better for a <span class="man">man</span> that he should flee and be saved than be
            caught and killed." </div>
         <div>
            Odysseus looked fiercely at him and said, "Son
            of Atreus, what are you talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some
            other and baser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Zeus has allotted a
            life of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. Is
            it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your
            peace, lest some other of the Achaeans hear you say what no <span class="man">man</span> who knows how
            to give good counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives
            should ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgment utterly for
            what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships into
            the water while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the hands of
            the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting
            when they see the ships being drawn into the water, but will cease attacking
            and keep turning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir leader,
            would be our destruction." </div>
         <div>
            Then said Diomedes, "Such an one is at hand; he
            is not far to seek, if you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though
            I am younger than any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who
            lies buried at Thebes. For Portheus
            had three noble sons, two of whom, Agrios and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was the horse<span class="man">man</span> Oeneus,
            my father's father, and he was the most valor [aretê] of them all. Oeneus remained in his own country, but my
            father (as Zeus and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married into the family of
            Adrastos, and his house was one of great abundance, for he had large estates of
            fertile grain-growing land, with much orchard ground as well, and he had many
            sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use of the spear. You must
            yourselves have heard whether these things are true or no; therefore when I say
            well despise not my words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say,
            then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When
            there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we
            get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, but we can spur on
            others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle
            hitherto." </div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile Poseidon had kept no blind look-out,
            and came up to them in the semblance of an old <span class="man">man</span>. He took Agamemnon's right
            hand in his own and said, "Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that
            he sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse - may
            he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the blessed gods
            are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the princes and counselors of
            the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon the plain, and you shall see them
            fleeing from the ships and tents towards their city." </div>
         <div>
            And Zeus answered, "Hera, you need not be
            afraid that either god or <span class="man">man</span> will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in
            such a dense golden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams
            shall not see through it." </div>
         <div>
            Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro
            among humankind, leaving Poseidon more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He
            darted forward among the first ranks and shouted saying, "Argives, shall we let
            Hektor son of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself
            with glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that Achilles is
            still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get on very well without him if we keep
            each other in heart and stand by one another. Now, therefore, let us all do as
            I say. Let us each take the best and largest shield we can lay hold of, put on
            our helmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; will lead
            you on, and Hektor son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out
            against us. If any good staunch warrior has only a small shield, let him hand
            it over to a worse <span class="man">man</span>, and take a larger one for himself." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had
            said. The son of Tydeus, Odysseus, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set
            the others in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of
            armor; the most valiant took the best armor, and gave the worse to the worse
            <span class="man">man</span>. When they had donned their bronze armor they marched on with Poseidon at
            their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen of edge and
            flashing like lightning; it is not the right thing [themis] to do, to come across it in the day of battle; all men quake
            for fear and keep away from it. </div>
         <div>
            under the men's feet as they fought - brought
            there to give support to the ships' sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught
            up one of them and struck Hektor above the rim of his shield close to his neck;
            the blow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. As an oak
            falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of father Zeus, and there
            is a terrible smell of brimstone - no <span class="man">man</span> can help being dismayed if he is
            standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing - even so did Hektor
            fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but his shield
            and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armor rang about him. </div>
         <div>
            The Argives were stung by grief [akhos] on account of this boasting. Ajax son of
            Telamon was more angry than any, for the <span class="man">man</span> had fallen close be, him; so he
            aimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by
            swerving aside and the spear struck Arkhelokhos son of Antenor, for heaven
            counseled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs from the neck
            at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the tendons at the back of the
            head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs and
            knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, "Think, Polydamas, and
            tell me truly whether this <span class="man">man</span> is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was:
            he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the horseman
            Antenor, for he is very like him." </div>
         <div>
            As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every <span class="man">man</span>
            looked round about to see whither he might flee for safety. </div>
         <div>
            Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the Argives to
            bear away blood-stained spoils after Poseidon lord of the earthquake had turned
            the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first to wound Hyrtios son of
            Gyrtios, leader of the staunch Mysians. Antilokhos killed Phalces and Mermerus,
            while Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and
            Periphetes. The son of Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in
            the flank, and the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among
            them; on this his life-breath [psukhê] came
            hurrying out of him at the place where he had been wounded, and his eyes were
            closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus killed more than any other, for there
            was no <span class="man">man</span> so fleet as he to pursue fleeing foes when Zeus had spread panic
            among them.

            On this Hera sat down, and the gods were
            troubled throughout the house of Zeus. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow
            was furrowed with care, and she spoke up in a rage. "Fools that we are," she
            cried, "to be thus madly angry with Zeus; we keep on wanting to go up to him
            and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for nobody,
            for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals. Make the
            best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose to send each one of you; Ares,
            I take it, has had a taste of them already, for his son Askalaphos has fallen
            in battle - the <span class="man">man</span> whom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he
            owns himself to be." </div>
         <div>
            Then spoke Thoas son of Andraimon, leader of
            the Aetolians, a <span class="man">man</span> who could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in
            close fight, while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided.
            He then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "What, in heaven's
            name, do I now see? Is it not Hektor come to life again? Every one made sure he
            had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems that one of the gods has
            again rescued him. He has killed many of us Danaans already, and I take it will
            yet do so, for the hand of Zeus must be with him or he would never dare show
            himself so masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us all
            do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the
            ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand firm,
            and see whether we cannot hold Hektor back at the point of our spears as soon
            as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then think better of it before he
            tries to charge into the press of the Danaans." </div>
         <div>
            The fight then became more scattered and they
            killed one another where they best could. Hektor killed Stichios and
            Arkesilaos, the one, leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade
            of Menestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasos. The first was bastard son to Oileus, and brother to
            Ajax, but he lived in Phylake away from his own country, for he had killed a
            <span class="man">man</span>, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasos had become a leader of the Athenians,
            and was son of Sphelus the son of Boukolos. Polydamas killed Mekisteus, and
            Polites Echios, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Klonios.
            Paris struck Deiochus from behind
            in the lower part of the shoulder, as he was fleeing among the foremost, and
            the point of the spear went clean through him. </div>
         <div>
            While they were spoiling these heroes of their
            armor, the Achaeans were fleeing pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and
            were forced back within their wall. Hektor then cried out to the Trojans,
            "Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any <span class="man">man</span> keeping back on
            the other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed: his kinsmen
            and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but dogs shall tear him in
            pieces in front of our city." </div>
         <div>
            As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses'
            shoulders and called to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted
            with a cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his own.
            Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the deep trench into
            its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad as the throw of a spear
            when a <span class="man">man</span> is trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured over the
            bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down the
            wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore has
            built a house of sand and then kicks it down again and destroys it - even so
            did you, O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with
            panic and confusion. </div>
         <div>
            Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their
            ships, calling out to one another and raising their hands with loud cries every
            <span class="man">man</span> to heaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up
            his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently than any
            of them. "Father Zeus," said he, "if ever any one in wheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or
            heifer and prayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head
            to him in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph
            thus over the Achaeans." </div>
         <div>
            Now Patroklos, so long as the Achaeans and
            Trojans were fighting about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the
            ships, remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylos, entertaining him with
            his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When,
            however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while the
            Achaeans were clamoring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his
            two thighs with the flat of his hands. "Eurypylos," said he in his dismay, "I
            know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer, for there is
            hard fighting going on; a squire [therapôn] shall
            take care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him to
            fight if I can; who knows but with the help of a daimôn I may persuade him. a <span class="man">man</span> does well to listen to the advice
            of a friend." </div>
         <div>
            He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him,
            but he hit Lykophron a follower [therapôn] of Ajax,
            who came from Cythera, but was living
            with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a <span class="man">man</span> among the Cythereans. Hektor's spear
            struck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the ship's prow
            on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook with rage and said to his
            brother, "Teucer, my good man, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen,
            he came to live with us from Cythera
            and whom we honored as much as our own parents. Hektor has just killed him;
            fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you." </div>
         <div>
            He hurried away when he had thus spurred
            Antilokhos, who at once darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear,
            after looking carefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the
            dart did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippos the
            proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward, and
            his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Antilokhos
            sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was
            breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even so, O Melanippos, did
            stalwart Antilokhos spring upon you to strip you of your armor; but noble
            Hektor marked him, and came running up to him through the thick of the battle.
            Antilokhos, brave warrior though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled
            like some savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has
            killed a dog or a <span class="man">man</span> who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can be
            gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor flee, and the Trojans and
            Hektor with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons after him; nor did
            he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached his comrades. </div>
         <div>
            They had now reached the ships and the prows of
            those that had been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans
            came pouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of
            ships, but they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and
            scattered; shame [aidôs] and fear restrained them.
            They kept shouting incessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of
            strength to the Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every <span class="man">man</span> by his parents,
            and beseeching him to stand firm. </div>
         <div>
            Ajax could not bring himself to retreat along
            with the rest, but strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands
            twelve cubits long and jointed with rings. As a <span class="man">man</span> skilled in feats of
            horsemanship couples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along
            the public way from the country into some large town - many both men and women
            marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his horse, springing
            from one to another without ever missing his feet while the horses are at a
            gallop - even so did Ajax go striding from one ship's deck to another, and his
            voice went up into the heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans
            and exhorting them to defend their ships and tents;</div>

      <div>
         <div>
            Then, O horse<span class="man">man</span> Patroklos, with a deep sigh you
            answered, "Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not
            be angry, but I feel grief [akhos] for the disaster
            that has now befallen the Argives. All those who have been their champions so
            far are lying at the ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomedes son of
            Tydeus has been hit with a spear, while famed Odysseus and Agamemnon have
            received sword-wounds;</div>
         <div>
            Eurypylos again has been struck with an arrow in
            the thigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing them
            of their wounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be my
            lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning of your own good
            name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless you now save the
            Argives from ruin? You know no pity; horse<span class="man">man</span> Peleus was not your father nor
            Thetis your mother, but the gray sea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you,
            so cruel and remorseless are you in your thinking [noos]. If however you are kept back through knowledge of some
            oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something from the mouth of Zeus,
            at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance to the
            Danaans. Let me moreover wear your armor; the Trojans may thus mistake me for
            you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have
            breathing time- which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are fresh
            might soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their own city." </div>
         <div>
            He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was
            suing for his own destruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, "What,
            noble Patroklos, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding, nor
            has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Zeus, but I am cut to the very
            heart with grief [akhos] that one of my own rank
            should dare to rob me because he is more powerful than I am. This grief [akhos], after all that I have gone through, is more
            than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I
            won as the fruit of my spear on having sacked a city - her has King Agamemnon
            taken from me as though I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be
            bygones: no <span class="man">man</span> may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till
            battle and the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my
            armor about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the dark
            cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet;</div>
         <div>
            the Argives are driven back on to the beach,
            cooped within a narrow space, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against
            them, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them. Had they
            seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled
            with their dead as they fled back again. And so it would have been, if only
            King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset our
            host. Diomedes son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans,
            neither have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated
            [ekhthrê] head, whereas that of murderous Hektor
            rings in my cars as he gives orders to the Trojans, who triumph over the
            Achaeans and fill the whole plain with their cry of battle. But even so,
            Patroklos, fall upon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and
            deprive us of our safe homecoming [nostos]. Bring
            to fulfillment [telos] what I now order you to do,
            so that you may win me great honor [timê] from all
            the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl to me again and give me rich
            gifts into the bargain. When you have driven the Trojans from the ships, come
            back again. Though Hera's thundering husband  should put triumph within your
            reach, do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob me of
            glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go on killing the
            Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilion, lest one of the ever-living gods from Olympus attack you - for Phoebus Apollo loves
            them well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage
            war upon the plain. Would, by father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that not a
            single <span class="man">man</span> of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the Argives, but
            that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of
            Troy." </div>
         <div>
            for none other of the Achaeans could wield it,
            though Achilles could do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion,
            which Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to
            deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with all speed,
            for he was the <span class="man">man</span> whom he held in honor next after Achilles, and on whose
            support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the
            fleet horses Xanthos and Balios,
            steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge
            bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the
            river Okeanos. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasos, whom Achilles
            had brought away with him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who, mortal
            steed though he was, could take his place along with those that were immortal. </div>
         <div>
            The second company was led by noble Eudoros,
            son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas, graceful in dancing
            [khoros], bore him; the mighty slayer of
            Argos was enamored of her as he
            saw her among the singing women at a dance [khoros]
            held in honor of Artemis the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he
            therefore - Hermes, giver of all good - went with her into an upper chamber,
            and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudoros,
            singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Eileithuia goddess of the
            pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and he saw the face of
            the sun, mighty Echekles son of Aktor took the mother to wife, and gave great
            wealth to gain her, but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care
            of him, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own son. The third
            company was led by Peisandros son of Maimalos, the finest spearman among all
            the Myrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroklos. The old horse<span class="man">man</span> Phoenix
            was leader of the fourth company, and Alkimedon, noble son of Laerceus of the
            fifth. </div>
         <div>
            With these words he put heart and soul into
            them all, and they serried their companies yet more closely when they heard the
            of their king. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high
            house which is to give shelter from the winds - even so closely were the
            helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed on shield,
            helm on helm, and <span class="man">man</span> on <span class="man">man</span>; so close were they that the horse-hair plumes on
            the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they bent their
            heads. </div>
         <div>
            In front of them all two men put on their armor
            - Patroklos and Automedon - two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons.
            Then Achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which
            silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had
            filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick rugs. In this
            chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no <span class="man">man</span> but himself might
            drink, nor would he make offering from it to any other god save only to father
            Zeus. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulfur; this done he
            rinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine. Then he
            stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making
            his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Zeus whose joy is in thunder.
            "King Zeus," he cried, "lord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi, you who dwell afar, you who hold
            wintry Dodona in your sway, where
            your seers the Selloi dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their
            couches made upon the ground - if you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime,
            and did me honor while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, grant me now the
            fulfillment of yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my assembly
            [agôn] of ships are lying, but I shall send my
            comrade into battle at the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Zeus,
            that victory may go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hektor may
            learn whether my squire [therapôn] is <span class="man">man</span> enough to
            fight alone, or whether his might is only then so indomitable when I myself
            enter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry
            of battle from the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armor and
            his comrades, fighters in close combat." </div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile the armed band that was about
            Patroklos marched on till they sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came
            swarming out like wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly
            children love to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung
            - or again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident, every
            wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones- even with such
            rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their cry of
            battle rose heavenwards. Patroklos called out to his men at the top of his
            voice, "Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be men my friends,
            fight with might and with main, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus,
            who is far the foremost <span class="man">man</span> at the ships of the Argives - he, and his close
            fighting followers [therapontes]. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus
            recognize his derangement [atê] in showing no
            respect to the bravest of the Achaeans." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each
            of them kill his <span class="man">man</span>. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on
            them when they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock
            through the carelessness of the shepherd - and when the wolves see this they
            pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves- even so did the
            Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in their panic
            and had no more fight left in them. </div>
         <div>
            Patroklos kept on heading his horses wherever
            he saw most men fleeing in confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots
            were being smashed in all directions, and many a <span class="man">man</span> came tumbling down from
            his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroklos, whose immortal
            steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound as they
            sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hektor, for he had set his
            heart on spearing him, but Hektor's horses were now hurrying him away. As the
            whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day when Zeus rains his
            hardest to punish men for judging [krinô] crookedly
            in their courts, and arriving justice there from without heed to the decrees
            [themistes] of heaven - all the rivers run full
            and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the
            mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of men - even such
            was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their flight. </div>
         <div>
            Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who
            wore unbelted tunics, being overcome by Patroklos son of Menoitios, he rebuked
            the Lycians saying. "Shame [aidôs] on you, where
            are you fleeing to? Show your mettle; I will myself meet this <span class="man">man</span> in fight and
            learn who it is that is so masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has
            stretched many a brave <span class="man">man</span> upon the ground." </div>
         <div>
            and his brains inside his helmet were all
            battered in, so that he fell face foremost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there
            died. Patroklos was enraged with grief [akhos] over
            by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a
            hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so swiftly, O noble
            horse<span class="man">man</span> Patroklos, did you make straight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge
            your comrade. Forthwith he struck Sthenelaos the son of Ithaimenes on the neck
            with a stone, and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this
            Hektor and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a <span class="man">man</span> can throw a
            javelin in competition [athlos] for some prize, or
            even in battle - so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.
            Glaukos, leader of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, by killing
            Bathykles son of Khalkon who lived in Hellas and was supreme in wealth [olbos] among the Myrmidons. Glaukos turned round suddenly, just as
            Bathykles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him, and drove his
            spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the
            ground, and the fall of so good a <span class="man">man</span> filled the Achaeans with dismay [akhos], while the Trojans were exultant, and came up
            in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their
            prowess, bore straight down upon them. </div>
         <div>
            He led the way as he spoke and the hero went
            forward with him. As the sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the
            mountains- and the thud of their axes is heard afar - even such a din now rose
            from earth-clash of bronze armor and of good ox-hide shields, as men smote each
            other with their swords and spears pointed at both ends. a <span class="man">man</span> had need of good
            eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head to foot with spears
            and blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as flies that buzz round the
            full milk-pails in the season [hôra] of spring when
            they are brimming with milk - even so did they gather round Sarpedon; nor did
            Zeus turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but kept looking at
            it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill Patroklos, and
            considering whether Hektor should be allowed to end him now in the fight round
            the body of Sarpedon, and strip him of his armor, or whether he should let him
            give yet further trouble [ponos] to the Trojans. In
            the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire [therapôn] of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hektor and the
            Trojans back towards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he
            made Hektor turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and fled, bidding
            the other Trojans flee also,</div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile Patroklos, with many a shout to his
            horses and to Automedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and
            foolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus,
            he would have, escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels [noos] of Zeus pass man's understanding; he will put
            even a brave <span class="man">man</span> to flight and snatch victory from his grasp, or again he will
            set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of
            Patroklos. </div>
         <div>
            The sons of the Achaeans would now have taken
            Troy by the hands of Patroklos,
            for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo taken his stand
            upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the Trojans. Thrice did
            Patroklos charge at an angle of the high wall, and thrice did Apollo beat him
            back, striking his shield with his own immortal hands. When Patroklos was
            coming on like a daimôn for yet a fourth time,
            Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said, "Draw back, noble
            Patroklos, it is not your lot to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor
            yet will it be that of Achilles who is a far better <span class="man">man</span> than you are." On
            hearing this, Patroklos withdrew to some distance and avoided the anger [mênis] of Apollo. </div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile Hektor was waiting with his horses
            inside the Scaean gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on
            fighting, or to call the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus
            Apollo drew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asios, who
            was Hektor's uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas who lived in
            Phrygia by the waters of the river
            Sangarios; in his likeness Zeus' son Apollo now spoke to Hektor saying,
            "Hektor, why have you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as
            much better a <span class="man">man</span> than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue your slackness.
            Drive straight towards Patroklos, if so be that Apollo may grant you a triumph
            over him, and you may kill him." </div>
         <div>
            With this the god went back into the struggle
            [ponos], and Hektor bade Kebriones drive again
            into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, and struck panic into the Argives,
            while he gave triumph to Hektor and the Trojans. Hektor let the other Danaans
            alone and killed no <span class="man">man</span>, but drove straight at Patroklos. Patroklos then sprang
            from his chariot to the ground,</div>
         <div>
            with a spear in his left hand, and in his right
            a jagged stone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it,
            nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the
            stone struck Kebriones, Hektor's charioteer, a bastard son of Priam, as he held
            the reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the forehead and drove his brows
            into his head for the bone was smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his
            feet. He dropped dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was
            no more life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O horse<span class="man">man</span> Patroklos,
            saying, "Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well he dives. If we had
            been at sea [pontos] this <span class="man">man</span> would have dived from
            the ship's side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could stomach,
            even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his chariot on to the
            ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also among the Trojans." </div>
         <div>
            At this his mind became clouded in derangement
            [atê]; his limbs failed him, and he stood as one
            dazed; whereon Euphorbos son of Panthoos, a Dardanian, the best spearman of his
            time, as also the finest horse<span class="man">man</span> and fleetest runner, came behind him and
            struck him in the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. This <span class="man">man</span> as
            soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so
            proficient was he in all the arts of war - he it was, O horse<span class="man">man</span> Patroklos,
            that first drove a weapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you.
            Euphorbos then ran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of
            the wound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroklos, unarmed though he
            now was, to attack him; but Patroklos unnerved, alike by the blow the god had
            given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear for
            his life. Hektor on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving ground, forced
            his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him in the lower
            part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so
            that he fell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a lion
            has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him - the two fight furiously upon
            the mountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink, and the
            lion has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe - even so did Hektor son of
            Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoitios who had killed so many,
            striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while. "Patroklos,"
            said he, "you deemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of
            their freedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool;
            Hektor and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I
            am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off
            them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles with
            all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you left him he
            charged you straitly saying, ‘Come not back to the ships, horse<span class="man">man</span> Patroklos,
            till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hektor about his body.
            Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool's heart answered him ‘yea’ within
            you." </div>
         <div>
            Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you
            answered, O horse<span class="man">man</span> Patroklos: "Hektor, vaunt as you will, for Zeus the son of
            Kronos and Apollo have granted you victory; it is they who have vanquished me
            so easily, and they who have stripped the armor from my shoulders; had twenty
            such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before my spear.
            Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbos;
            you are yourself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and lay my
            saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little season; death and the
            day of your doom are close upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of
            Achilles son of Aiakos." When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in the
            doom [telos] of death, his life-breath [psukhê] left his body and flitted down to the house of
            Hades, mourning its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its
            manhood. Dead though he was, Hektor still spoke to him saying, "Patroklos, why
            should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,
            may be smitten by my spear and die before me?" </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 17</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            As he spoke he struck Menelaos full on the
            shield, but the spear did not go through, for the shield turned its point.
            Menelaos then took aim, praying to father Zeus as he did so; Euphorbos was
            drawing back, and Menelaos struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning
            his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went clean
            through his neck, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to
            the ground. His locks of hair, so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,
            were all bedrabbled with flecks of blood, which looked like myrtle-blossoms
            [kharites]. As one who has grown a fine young
            olive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water - the plant is
            full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts
            forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce wind sweep down upon it
            and level it with the ground - even so did Menelaos strip the fair youth
            Euphorbos of his armor after he had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the
            mountains in the pride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd
            as it is feeding - first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then
            gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry
            against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close to him, for they are
            pale with fear - even so no one had the courage to face valiant Menelaos. The
            son of Atreus would have then carried off the armor of the son of Panthoos with
            ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of
            the Kikones incited Hektor to attack him. "Hektor," said he, "you are now going
            after the horses of the noble son of Aiakos, but you will not take them; they
            cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal <span class="man">man</span>, save only by Achilles, who is
            son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaos son of Atreus has bestridden the
            body of Patroklos and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbos son of
            Panthoos, so that he can fight no more." </div>
         <div>
            Then Glaukos son of Hippolokhos looked fiercely
            at Hektor and rebuked him sternly. "Hektor," said he, "you make a brave show,
            but in fight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so
            great a glory [kleos]. Think how you may now save
            your town and citadel by the hands of your own people born in Ilion; for you will get no Lycians to fight
            for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their incessant hardships. Are
            you likely, sir, to do anything to help a <span class="man">man</span> of less note, after leaving
            Sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and
            prey of the Danaans? So long as he lived he did good service [kharis] both to your city and yourself; yet you had no
            stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians will listen to me, they
            will go home and leave Troy to its
            fate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays hold of
            men who are engaging in the struggle [ponos] for
            their land and harassing those who would attack it,</div>
         <div>
            we should soon bear off Patroklos into
            Ilion. Could we get this dead <span class="man">man</span>
            away and bring him into the city of Priam, the Argives would readily give up
            the armor of Sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot. For he whose squire
            [therapôn] has been now killed is the foremost
            <span class="man">man</span> at the ships of the Achaeans - he and his close-fighting followers [therapontes]. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand
            against Ajax, nor face him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a
            braver <span class="man">man</span> than you are." </div>
         <div>
            Hektor scowled at him and answered, "Glaukos,
            you should know better. I have held you so far as a <span class="man">man</span> of more understanding
            than any in all Lycia, but now I
            despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax. I fear neither battle nor the
            din of chariots, but Zeus' will [noos] is stronger
            than ours; Zeus at one time makes even a strong <span class="man">man</span> draw back and snatches
            victory from his grasp, while at another he will set him on to fight. Come
            hither then, my friend, stand by me and see indeed whether I shall play the
            coward the whole day through as you say, or whether I shall not stay some even
            of the boldest Danaans from fighting round the body of Patroklos." </div>
         <div>
            Menelaos did as he said, and shouted to the
            Danaans for help at the top of his voice. "My friends," he cried, "princes and
            counselors of the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaos drink at the
            public cost, and give orders each to his own people as Zeus grants him power
            and honor [timê], the fight is so thick about me
            that I cannot distinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every <span class="man">man</span>
            unbidden, and think it shame that Patroklos should become meat and morsel for
            Trojan hounds." </div>
         <div>
            At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back,
            and they withdrew from the dead <span class="man">man</span> daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in
            killing any one, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not
            lose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus
            alike in stature and prowess,</div>
         <div>
            As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the
            others, who then rallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared
            Leiokritos son of Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lykomedes, and Lykomedes was
            moved with pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared
            Apisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff,
            so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best <span class="man">man</span> of them
            all after Asteropaios. Asteropaios flew forward to avenge him and attack the
            Danaans, but this might no longer be,</div>
         <div>
            inasmuch as those about Patroklos were well
            covered by their shields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had
            given them strict orders that no <span class="man">man</span> was either to give ground, or to stand out
            before the others, but all were to hold well together about the body and fight
            hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as
            the corpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of the Trojans and
            allies, and on that of the Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless
            fight though many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend
            and stand by one another. </div>
         <div>
            Thus through the livelong day did they wage
            fierce war, and the sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them,
            and on their hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire [therapôn] of the fleet son of Peleus. It was as when a
            <span class="man">man</span> gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to his men, and bids them stretch
            it; whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves it,
            and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is well stretched
            -</div>
         <div>
            The Trojans also on their part spoke to one
            another saying, "Friends, though we fall to a <span class="man">man</span> beside this body, let none
            shrink from fighting." With such words did they exhort each other. They fought
            and fought, and an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vault of
            heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aiakos stood out of the fight and wept
            when they heard that their driver had been laid low by the hand of murderous
            Hektor.</div>
         <div>
            Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed them
            again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and many a time did
            he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to the ships by the waters of
            the broad Hellespont, nor yet into
            battle among the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as a
            pillar set over the tomb of some dead <span class="man">man</span> or woman, and bowed their heads to
            the ground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned the loss of their
            charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on
            either side the yoke. </div>
         <div>
            As he spoke he breathed heart and strength into
            the horses so that they shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their
            chariot swiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind
            them fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture amid a flock
            of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he dashed amid the throng
            of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no <span class="man">man</span>, for he
            could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone in the
            chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alkimedon, son of Laerkes son of Haimon
            caught sight of him and came up behind his chariot. "Automedon," said he, "what
            god has put this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that
            you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who was your comrade
            is slain, and Hektor plumes himself on being armed in the armor of the
            descendant of Aiakos." </div>
         <div>
            He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the
            spear struck the round shield of Aretos, and went right through it for the
            shield stayed it not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower
            part of his belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow
            behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck so
            that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretos give one bound and
            then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of
            him. Hektor then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and stooped
            forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the point stuck in the
            ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Ares robbed it of its force.
            They would then have fought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes
            forced their way through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and
            parted them for all their fury - for Hektor, Aeneas, and Chromios were afraid
            and drew back, leaving Aretos to lie there struck to the heart. Automedon, peer
            of fleet Ares, then stripped him of his armor and vaunted over him saying, "I
            have done little to assuage my sorrow [akhos] for
            the son of Menoitios, for the <span class="man">man</span> I have killed is not so good as he was." </div>
         <div>
            wrapped in such radiant raiment, did Athena go
            in among the host and speak <span class="man">man</span> by <span class="man">man</span> to each. First she took the form and
            voice of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaos son of Atreus, who was standing near
            her. "Menelaos," said she, "it will be shame and dishonor to you, if dogs tear
            the noble comrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be so also." </div>
         <div>
            Athena was pleased at his having named herself
            before any of the other gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and
            shoulders, and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet
            come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood- even so bold
            as this did she make him as he stood over Patroklos and threw his spear. Now
            there was among the Trojans a <span class="man">man</span> named Podes, son of Eetion, who was both rich
            and valiant. Hektor held him in the highest honor in the district [dêmos], for he was his comrade and boon companion; the
            spear of Menelaos struck this <span class="man">man</span> in the belt just as he had turned in flight,
            and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaos son
            of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his own people. </div>
         <div>
            Apollo then went up to Hektor and spurred him
            on to fight, in the likeness of Phainops son of Asios who lived in Abydos and was the most favored of all
            Hektor's guests. In his likeness Apollo said, "Hektor, who of the Achaeans will
            fear you henceforward now that you have quailed before Menelaos who has ever
            been rated poorly as a warrior? Yet he has now got a corpse away from the
            Trojans single-handed, and has slain your own true comrade, a <span class="man">man</span> brave among
            the foremost, Podes son of Eetion. </div>
         <div>
            Ajax and Menelaos noted how Zeus had turned the
            scale in favor of the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. "Alas," said he,
            "even a fool may see that father Zeus is helping the Trojans. All their weapons
            strike home; no matter whether it be a brave <span class="man">man</span> or a coward that hurls them,
            Zeus speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them without effect. What,
            then, will be best both as regards rescuing the body, and our return to the joy
            of our friends who will be grieving as they look hitherwards; for they will
            make sure that nothing can now check the terrible hands of Hektor, and that he
            will fling himself upon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell the
            son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news
            that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a <span class="man">man</span> among the
            Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in darkness. O
            father Zeus, lift this cloud from over the sons of the Achaeans; make heaven
            serene, and let us see; if you will that we perish, let us fall at any rate by
            daylight." </div>
         <div>
            On this Menelaos and Meriones took the dead <span class="man">man</span>
            in their arms and lifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host
            raised a hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body
            away, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at the loo of a
            band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at him as though they would
            tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on them in a fury, scaring and
            scattering them in all directions - even so did the Trojans for a while charge
            in a body, striking with sword and with spears pointed at both the ends, but
            when the two Ajaxes faced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no
            <span class="man">man</span> dared press on to fight further about the dead. </div>

      <div>
         <div>
            The bondswomen whom Achilles and Patroklos had
            taken captive screamed aloud for grief, beating their breasts, and with their
            limbs failing them for sorrow. Antilokhos bent over him the while, weeping and
            holding both his hands as he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a
            knife into his own throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard
            him as she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old <span class="man">man</span> her father,
            whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus that dwelt at
            the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There were Glauke, Thalia and
            Kymodoke, Nesaia, Speo, Thoe, and dark-eyed Halie, Kymothoe, Aktaia and
            Limnorea, Melite, Iaira, Amphithoe and Agaue, Doto and Proto, Pherousa and
            Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and Kallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous
            sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and Kallianassa. There were also Klymene,
            Ianeira and Ianassa, Maira, Oreithuia
            and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who dwell in the depths of
            the sea. The crystal cave was filled with their multitude and they all beat
            their breasts while Thetis led them in their lament. </div>
         <div>
            Achilles groaned and answered, "Mother, Olympian
            Zeus has indeed granted me the fulfillment of my prayer, but what boots it to
            me, seeing that my dear comrade Patroklos has fallen - he whom I valued more
            than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him; aye, and
            Hektor when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armor, so glorious to
            behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you in the couch of a
            mortal <span class="man">man</span>. Would that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs,
            and that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal bride. For now you shall have
            grief [penthos] infinite by reason of the death of
            that son whom you can never welcome home- nay, I will not live nor go about
            among humankind unless Hektor fall by my spear, and thus pay me for having
            slain Patroklos son of Menoitios." </div>
         <div>
            Therefore, perish strife both from among gods
            and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous <span class="man">man</span> will harden his heart - which
            rises up in the soul of a <span class="man">man</span> like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than
            drops of honey. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet - so be it, for it is
            over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will
            pursue Hektor who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then abide my
            doom when it may please Zeus and the other gods to send it. Even Herakles, the
            best beloved of Zeus - even he could not escape the hand of death, but fate and
            Hera's fierce anger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like
            doom awaits me. Till then I will win fame [kleos],
            and will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks
            with both their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall
            they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer. Hold me
            not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall not move me." </div>
         <div>
            Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, "How
            can I go up into the battle? They have my armor. My mother forbade me to arm
            till I should see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armor from
            Hephaistos; I know no <span class="man">man</span> whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax
            son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and wielding
            his spear about the body of dead Patroklos." </div>
         <div>
            Now the Trojans when they had come out of the
            fight, unyoked their horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their
            supper. They kept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had
            fallen upon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof
            so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthoos was first to speak, a <span class="man">man</span> of
            judgment, who alone among them could look both before and after. He was comrade
            to Hektor, and they had been born upon the same night; with all sincerity and
            goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:- </div>
         <div>
            "Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you
            to go back now to your city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we
            are far from our walls. So long as this <span class="man">man</span> has anger [mênis] against Agamemnon, the Achaeans were easier to deal with, and
            I would have gladly camped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I
            go in great fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never
            bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valor,
            but he will try to storm our city and carry off our women.</div>
         <div>
            Hektor looked fiercely at him and answered,
            "Polydamas, your words are not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be
            pent within the city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls?
            In the old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for its
            wealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of our houses, and
            much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia, for the hand of Zeus has been laid
            heavily upon us. Now, therefore, that the son of scheming Kronos has granted me
            to win glory here and to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in
            this fool's wise among the population [dêmos]. You
            will have no <span class="man">man</span> with you; it shall not be; do all of you as I now say; - take
            your suppers in your companies throughout the host, and keep your watches and
            be wakeful every <span class="man">man</span> of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let
            him gather them and give them out among the people. Better let these, rather
            than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about the
            ships; granted that Achilles has again come forward to defend them, let it be
            as he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but will fight
            him, to fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all, and the
            slayer may yet be slain." </div>
         <div>
            Thus spoke Hektor; and the Trojans, fools that
            they were, shouted in approval, for Pallas Athena had robbed them of their
            understanding. They gave ear to Hektor with his evil counsel, but the wise
            words of Polydamas no <span class="man">man</span> would heed. They took their supper throughout the
            host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned Patroklos, and
            the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his murderous hands upon
            the breast of his comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a
            <span class="man">man</span> who was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense forest; when
            the lion comes back he is furious, and searches dingle and dell to track the
            hunter if he can find him, for he is mad with rage - even so with many a sigh
            did Achilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, "Alas! vain were the words with
            which I cheered the hero Menoitios in his own house; I said that I would bring
            his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked Ilion and taken his share of the spoils - but
            Zeus does not give all men their heart's desire. The same soil shall be
            reddened here at Troy by the blood of
            us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home by the old horse<span class="man">man</span> Peleus, nor
            by my mother Thetis, but even in this place shall the earth cover me.
            Nevertheless, O Patroklos, now that I am left behind you, I will not bury you,
            till I have brought hither the head and armor of mighty Hektor who has slain
            you. Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you;
            till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women of
            Troy and Dardanos, whom we have
            taken with spear and strength of arm when we sacked men's goodly cities, shall
            weep over you both night and day." </div>
         <div>
            And Hera answered, "Dread son of Kronos, why
            should you say this thing? May not a <span class="man">man</span> though he be only mortal and knows
            less than we do, do what he can for another person? And shall not I - foremost
            of all goddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in heaven -
            devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?" </div>
         <div>
            Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly,
            for there was a quarrel [neikos], and two men were
            wrangling about the blood-price for a <span class="man">man</span> who had died, the one claiming to the
            dêmos that he had the right to pay off the
            damages in full, and the other refusing to accept anything. Each was seeking a
            limit [peirar], in the presence of an arbitrator
            [histôr], and the people took sides, each <span class="man">man</span>
            backing the side that he had taken;</div>
         <div>
            He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and
            thrice ploughed already. Many men were working at the plough within it, turning
            their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on
            reaching the headland a <span class="man">man</span> would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,
            and they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time when they
            should again reach the headland. The part that they had ploughed was dark
            behind them, so that the field, though it was of gold, still looked as if it
            were being ploughed - very curious to behold. </div>
         <div>
            Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which
            Daedalus once made in Knossos for
            lovely Ariadne. Here was a dance [khoros] of youths and maidens, whom all would
            woo, all with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens wore robes of
            light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were slightly oiled. The
            girls were crowned with garlands, while the young men had daggers of gold that
            hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring with merry
            twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work and making trial of his
            wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with
            one another, and many people was gathered joyously about the place of dancing
            [khoros]. There was a bard also to sing to them
            and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of
            them when the <span class="man">man</span> struck up with his tune. </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 19</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            Now when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening
            from the streams of Okeanos, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis
            reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her. She found her son
            fallen about the body of Patroklos and weeping bitterly. Many also of his
            followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among them she
            clasped his hand in her own, saying, "My son, grieve as we may we must let this
            <span class="man">man</span> lie, for it is by heaven's will that he has fallen; now, therefore, accept
            from Hephaistos this rich and goodly armor, which no <span class="man">man</span> has ever yet borne
            upon his shoulders." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in
            that he had put away his anger [mênis]. Then
            Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the middle of the
            assembly. "Danaan heroes," said he, "squires [therapontes] of Ares, it is well to listen when a <span class="man">man</span> stands up to
            speak, and it is not seemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a
            practiced speaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest
            orator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do
            you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken to
            me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I who was responsible [aitios]: Zeus, and Fate [Moira], and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me with derangement
            [atê] when we were assembled on the day that I
            took from Achilles the prize that had been awarded to him. What could I do? All
            things are in the hand of heaven, and Atê, eldest
            of Zeus' daughters, shuts men's eyes to their destruction. She walks
            delicately, not on the solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make
            them stumble or to ensnare them. </div>
         <div>
            "Time was when she fooled Zeus himself, who they
            say is greatest whether of gods or men; for Hera, woman though she was,
            beguiled him on the day when Alkmene was to bring forth mighty Herakles in the
            fair city of Thebes. He told it out
            among the gods saying, ‘Hear me all gods and goddesses, that I may speak even
            as I am minded; this day shall an Eileithuia, helper of women who are in labor,
            bring a <span class="man">man</span> child into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about
            him who are of my blood and lineage.’ Then said Hera all crafty and full of
            guile, ‘You will play false, and will not hold to the finality [telos] of your word. Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a
            great oath, that he who shall this day fall between the feet of a woman, shall
            be lord over all that dwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.’ </div>
         <div>
            Then Odysseus said, "Achilles, godlike and
            brave, send not the Achaeans thus against Ilion to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be no
            brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides with fury;
            bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships, for in this there is
            strength and stay. no <span class="man">man</span> can do battle the livelong day to the going down of
            the sun if he is without food; however much he may want to fight his strength
            will fail him before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his
            limbs will grow weary under him. But a <span class="man">man</span> can fight all day if he is full fed
            with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he
            has routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them prepare
            their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence of the
            assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied. Moreover let him
            swear an oath before the Argives that he has never gone up into the couch of
            Briseis, nor has lain down with her, even though it is right [themis] for humans, both men and women, to do this;
            and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you
            in his tents with a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues
            in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it
            is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in the
            first instance." </div>
         <div>
            Odysseus answered, "Achilles, son of Peleus,
            mightiest of all the Achaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more
            than a little, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of
            greater knowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of
            which men soon surfeit, and when Zeus, who is wars steward, weighs the upshot,
            it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is far heavier
            than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should mourn the dead with
            their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold continually; when should
            we have respite from our sorrow [ponos]? Let us
            mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but let those of
            us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely.
            In that hour let no <span class="man">man</span> hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons
            shall bode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us rather
            sally as one <span class="man">man</span> and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans." </div>
         <div>
            On this he broke up the assembly, and every <span class="man">man</span>
            went back to his own ship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them
            away to the ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the
            stable-men [therapontes] drove the horses in among the others. </div>
         <div>
            Then fleet Xanthos answered under the yoke - for white-armed Hera had
            endowed him with human speech - and he bowed his head till his mane touched the
            ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. "Dread Achilles," said he, "we
            will indeed save you now, but the day of your death is near, and we will not be
            responsible [aitioi], for it will be heaven and
            stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth or slackness
            on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroklos of his armor; it was the mighty
            god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he fought among the foremost, and
            granted a triumph to Hektor. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyros who they say
            is fleetest of all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a
            <span class="man">man</span> and of a god." </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 20</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            And Aeneas answered, "Why do you thus bid me
            fight the proud son of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face
            him now, it would not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to
            Right from Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessos and Pedasos;
            Zeus indeed saved me in that he granted me strength to flee, else had the
            fallen by the hands of Achilles and Athena, who went before him to protect him
            and urged him to fall upon the Leleges and Trojans. no <span class="man">man</span> may fight Achilles,
            for one of the gods is always with him as his guardian, and even were it not
            so, his weapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him
            who is against him; if heaven would let me fight him to the finish [telos] on even terms, he should not soon overcome me,
            though he boasts that he is made of bronze." </div>
         <div>
            Then said King Apollo, son to Zeus, "Nay, hero,
            pray to the ever-living gods, for men say that you were born of Zeus' daughter
            Aphrodite, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Aphrodite is
            child to Zeus, while Thetis is but daughter to the old <span class="man">man</span> of the sea. Bring,
            therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with his
            taunts and menaces." </div>
         <div>
            When they were now close up with one another
            Achilles was first to speak. "Aeneas," said he, "why do you stand thus out
            before the host to fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans,
            partaking of the honor [timê] of Priam? Nay, though
            you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over to you. He is a <span class="man">man</span> of sound
            judgment, and he has sons of his own. Or have the Trojans been allotting you a
            demesne of passing richness, fair with orchard lawns and wheat lands, if you
            should slay me? This you shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already.
            Have you forgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds
            helter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look behind
            you; you took refuge in Lyrnessos, but I attacked the city, and with the help
            of Athena and father Zeus I sacked it and carried its women into captivity,
            though Zeus and the other gods rescued you. You think they will protect you
            now, but they will not do so; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not
            face me, or you will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the event." </div>
         <div>
            "Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as
            for valor [aretê], Zeus gives it or takes it as he
            will, for he is lord of all. And now let there be no more of this prating in
            mid-battle as though we were children. We could fling taunts without end at one
            another; a hundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run in
            every which direction and talk all wise; it can go here and there, and as a <span class="man">man</span>
            says, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard like women
            who when they fall foul of one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one
            half true and the other lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall
            turn me now that I am fain to fight- therefore let us make trial of one another
            with our spears." </div>
         <div>
            Aeneas would then have struck Achilles as he
            was springing towards him, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered
            him, and Achilles would have closed with him and dispatched him with his sword,
            had not Poseidon lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith
            to the immortals, "Alas, I feel grief [akhos] for
            great Aeneas, who will now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son
            of Peleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will
            never save him from destruction. Why should this <span class="man">man</span> suffer grief [akhos] when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in
            another's quarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the
            gods that dwell in heaven? Let us then snatch him from death's jaws, lest the
            son of Kronos be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he
            should escape, and that the race of Dardanos, whom Zeus loved above all the
            sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or
            sign. For now indeed has Zeus hated the blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall
            reign over the Trojans, he and his children's children that shall be born
            hereafter." </div>
         <div>
            When earth-encircling Poseidon heard this he
            went into the battle amid the clash of spears, and came to the place where
            Achilles and Aeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the
            son of Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas,
            and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from off the
            earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of warriors both
            horse and foot did he soar as the god's hand sped him, till he came to the very
            fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were arming themselves for fight.
            Poseidon, shaker of the earth, then came near to him and said, Aeneas, what god
            has egged you on to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a
            mightier <span class="man">man</span> of valor and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before
            him whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even though
            fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among
            the foremost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans shall slay you." </div>
         <div>
            He sprang forward along the line and cheered
            his men on as he did so. "Let not the Trojans," he cried, "keep you at arm's
            length, Achaeans, but go for them and fight them <span class="man">man</span> for <span class="man">man</span>. However valiant I
            may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Ares, who is
            an immortal, or Athena, would shrink from flinging himself into the jaws of
            such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in me lies I will
            show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance, not even for a moment;
            I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture
            within reach of my spear." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes
            of the other. The chariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed
            over him in the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a
            valiant <span class="man">man</span> of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple through his
            bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear, but it went right on,
            crushing the bone so that the brain inside was shed in all directions, and his
            lust of fighting was ended. Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was
            springing down from his chariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He
            breathed his last, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging
            him to offer him in sacrifice to the King of Helike, and the heart of the earth-shaker is glad; even so did
            he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles then went in pursuit of Polydoros son of
            Priam, whom his father had always forbidden to fight because he was the
            youngest of his sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his
            folly and showing off the excellence [aretê] of his
            speed, was rushing about among front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles
            struck him in the middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck him
            just at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the
            double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and
            came out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of
            darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in his hands. </div>
         <div>
            He looked fiercely on Hektor and said, "Draw
            near, that you may meet your doom the sooner." Hektor feared him not and
            answered, "Son of Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I
            were a child; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are a
            mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies in the lap
            of heaven whether I, worse <span class="man">man</span> though I be, may not slay you with my spear, for
            this too has been found keen ere now." </div>
         <div>
            On this he struck Dryops with his spear, about
            the middle of his neck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie
            and stayed Demoukhos son of Philetor, a <span class="man">man</span> both brave and of great stature, by
            hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword and
            killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonos and Dardanos, sons of Bias, and threw them
            from their chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he
            cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor - he
            came up to Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that he would spare him
            and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,
            he might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the <span class="man">man</span> was in no
            mood for pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid
            hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his
            sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all
            covered with the black blood that welled from the wound. Thus did death close
            his eyes as he lay lifeless. </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 21</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise,
            "What marvel do I see here? If this <span class="man">man</span> can come back alive after having been
            sold over into Lemnos, I shall have
            the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from the world below. Could not even
            the waters of the gray sea [pontos] imprison him, as they do many another
            whether he will or no? This time let him taste my spear, that I may know for
            certain whether mother earth who can keep even a strong <span class="man">man</span> down, will be able
            to hold him, or whether thence too he will return." </div>
         <div>
            With such words did the princely son of Priam
            beseech Achilles; but Achilles answered him sternly. "Idiot," said he, "talk
            not to me of ransom. Until Patroklos fell I preferred to give the Trojans
            quarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but now
            not a <span class="man">man</span> shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands before the
            city of Ilion -</div>
         <div>
            and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest with
            the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why should you
            whine in this way? Patroklos fell, and he was a better <span class="man">man</span> than you are. I too
            - see you not how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble father, and have a
            goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom and death overshadow me all as
            surely. The day will come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one
            shall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped
            from his bow." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, and Lykaon's heart sank
            within him. He loosed his hold of the spear, and held out both hands before
            him; but Achilles drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his
            neck; he plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he lay
            at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him till the
            earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung him into the
            river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, "Lie there
            among the fishes, who will lick the blood from your wound and gloat over it;
            your mother shall not lay you on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of
            Skamandros shall bear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the
            fishes feed on the fat of Lykaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the
            waters - so perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilion - you in flight, and I following after
            to destroy you. The river with its broad silver stream shall serve you in no
            stead, for all the bulls you offered him and all the horses that you flung
            living into his waters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is
            not a <span class="man">man</span> of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroklos and the havoc
            you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I held aloof from
            battle." </div>
         <div>
            spade in hand he clears away the dams to free
            the channels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with the water
            as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the <span class="man">man</span> can follow- even so did
            the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the
            gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive to stand his ground,
            and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in league against him, so
            often would the mighty wave come beating down upon his shoulders, and he would
            have to keep fleeing on and on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring
            him out as it flowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet. </div>
         <div>
            Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to
            heaven saying, "Father Zeus, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon
            me, and save me from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards.
            I blame [aitios] none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my dear mother, who has beguiled
            and tricked me. She told me I was to fall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would
            that Hektor, the best <span class="man">man</span> among the Trojans, might there slay me; then should I
            fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I shall come to a
            most pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I were some swineherd's boy,
            who gets carried down a torrent while trying to cross it during a storm." </div>
         <div>
            Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the
            wall looking down on huge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before
            him, and there was none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower
            and with many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders
            of the gate. "Keep the gates," said he, "wide open till the people come fleeing
            into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in rout before him.
            I see we are in great peril. As soon as our people are inside and in safety,
            close the strong gates for I fear lest that terrible <span class="man">man</span> should come bounding
            inside along with the others." </div>
         <div>
            So saying he stood on his guard and awaited
            Achilles, for he was now fain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from
            out a thick covert to attack a hunter - she knows no fear and is not dismayed
            by the baying of the hounds; even though the <span class="man">man</span> be too quick for her and wound
            her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced her she
            will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been killed
            outright - even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to flee till he had
            made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear, holding his round
            shield before him and crying with a loud voice. "Of a truth," said he, "noble
            Achilles, you deem that you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans.
            Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is many a brave <span class="man">man</span>
            of us still inside who will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives
            and children, to defend Ilion. Here
            therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue. </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 22</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            Thus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns,
            wiped the sweat from off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against
            the goodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their
            shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hektor stay where he
            was before Ilion and the Scaean gates.
            Then Phoebus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, "Why, son of Peleus, do
            you, who are but <span class="man">man</span>, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet found
            out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not inflict
            struggles [ponos] on the Trojans whom you had
            routed, and now they are within their walls, while you have been decoyed hither
            away from them. Me you cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me." </div>
         <div>
            Achilles was greatly angered and said, "You have
            baulked me, Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from
            the wall, where many another <span class="man">man</span> would have bitten the dust ere he got within
            Ilion; you have robbed me of great
            glory and have saved the Trojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing
            to fear, but I would indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so." </div>
         <div>
            beams blaze forth in time of harvest more
            brilliantly than those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them all
            though he be, he yet sends an ill sign [sêma] for
            mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train - even so did Achilles'
            armor gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his
            head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear son,
            imploring him to return; but Hektor still stayed before the gates, for his
            heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old <span class="man">man</span> reached out his arms
            towards him and bade him for pity's sake come within the walls. "Hektor," he
            cried, "my son, stay not to face this <span class="man">man</span> alone and unsupported, or you will
            meet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you.
            Monster that he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do,
            for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth,
            and a load of grief [akhos] would be lifted from my
            heart, for many a brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or
            selling them away in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two
            sons from among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lykaon and
            Polydoros, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be still alive
            and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with gold and bronze, of
            which we have store, for the old <span class="man">man</span> Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if
            they are already dead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two
            who were their parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived
            unless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the
            city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose
            your own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also
            on your unhappy father while life yet remains to him - on me, whom the son of
            Kronos will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old age, after I
            have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as captives, my bridal
            chambers pillaged,</div>
         <div>
            little children dashed to earth amid the rage of
            battle, and my sons' wives dragged away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in
            the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has
            beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared
            and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and
            then lie all distraught at my doors. When a young <span class="man">man</span> falls by the sword in
            battle, he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be
            seen, all is honorable in death, but when an old <span class="man">man</span> is slain there is nothing
            in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his gray hair and
            beard and all that men hide for shame [aidôs]." </div>
         <div>
            The old <span class="man">man</span> tore his gray hair as he spoke, but
            he moved not the heart of Hektor. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as
            she bared her bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. "Hektor,"
            she cried, weeping bitterly the while, "Hektor, my son, spurn not this breast,
            but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort from my own bosom,
            think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall to protect us from this
            <span class="man">man</span>; stand not without to meet him. Should the wretch kill you, neither I nor
            your richly dowered wife shall ever weep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed
            on which you lie, for dogs will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans." Thus
            did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not the heart of
            Hektor, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as he drew nearer
            towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains, full fed with deadly
            poisons, waits for the approach of <span class="man">man</span> - he is filled with fury and his eyes
            glare terribly as he goes writhing round his den - even so Hektor leaned his
            shield against a tower that jutted out from the wall and stood where he was,
            undaunted. </div>
         <div>
            "Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness of
            his heart, "if I go within the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap
            reproach upon me, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the
            city on that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not
            listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that my
            folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan women in
            the face, lest a worse <span class="man">man</span> should say, ‘Hektor has ruined us by his
            self-confidence.’ Surely it would be better for me to return after having
            fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here before the city. What,
            again, if were to lay down my shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall
            and go straight up to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up
            Helen, who was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that
            Alexander brought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans divide the half of
            everything that the city contains among themselves? I might make the Trojans,
            by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn oath that they would hide
            nothing, but would divide into two shares all that is within the city - but why
            argue with myself in this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind
            of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,
            when I had off my armor. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak
            tree as young men and maidens prattle with one another. Better fight him at
            once, and learn to which of us Zeus will grant victory." </div>
         <div>
            On they flew along the wagon-road that ran hard
            by under the wall, past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild
            fig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the river Skamandros.
            One of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a
            burning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow, or the
            ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the goodly
            washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before the coming of the
            Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to wash their
            clothes. Past these did they flee, the one in front and the other giving chase
            behind him: good was the <span class="man">man</span> that fled,</div>
         <div>
            "Alas," said he, "my eyes behold a <span class="man">man</span> who is
            dear to me being pursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hektor, who has burned the
            thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honor, at one while on the of many-valleyed
            Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round
            the city of Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether
            we shall now save him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles,
            son of Peleus." </div>
         <div>
            Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hektor,
            as a hound chasing a fawn which he has started from its covert on the
            mountains, and hunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him
            by crouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up
            until he gets her - even so there was no escape for Hektor from the fleet son
            of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian gates and under the
            walls, that his people might help him by showering down weapons from above,
            Achilles would gain on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself
            always on the city side. As a <span class="man">man</span> in a dream who fails to lay hands upon
            another whom he is pursuing - the one cannot escape nor the other overtake -
            even so neither could Achilles come up with Hektor, nor Hektor break away from
            Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time
            come when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his
            running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean
            host, and shook his head to show that no <span class="man">man</span> was to aim a dart at Hektor, lest
            another might win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come in
            second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for the fourth time,
            the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom in each of them,
            one for Achilles and the other for Hektor. As he held the scales by the middle,
            the doom of Hektor fell down deep into the house of Hades - and then Phoebus
            Apollo left him. Thereon Athena went close up to the son of Peleus and said,
            "Noble Achilles, favored of heaven, I think in my mind [noos] we two shall surely take back to the ships a triumph for the
            Achaeans by slaying Hektor, for all his lust of battle. Do what Apollo may as
            he lies groveling before his father, aegis-bearing Zeus, Hektor cannot escape
            us longer. Stay here and take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to
            make a stand and fight you." </div>
         <div>
            He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it.
            His aim was true for he hit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear
            rebounded from it, and did not pierce it. Hektor was angry when he saw that the
            weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no
            second spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobos and asked him for one, but
            there was no <span class="man">man</span>; then he saw the truth and said to himself, "Alas! the gods
            have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the hero Deiphobos was by my
            side, but he is within the wall, and Athena has inveigled me; death is now
            indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it - for so Zeus and
            his son Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been
            ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die
            ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that
            shall be told among men hereafter." </div>
         <div>
            When Achilles had done spoiling Hektor of his
            armor, he stood among the Argives and said, "My friends, princes and counselors
            of the Argives, now that heaven has granted us to overcome this <span class="man">man</span>, who has
            done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether we should not
            attack the city in force,</div>
         <div>
            and discover in what mind [noos] the Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will
            desert their city now that Hektor has fallen, or will still hold out even
            though he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way, while
            Patroklos is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned - he Whom I can
            never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails not? Though men forget
            their dead when once they are within the house of Hades, yet not even there
            will I forget the comrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let
            us raise the song of victory and go back to the ships taking this <span class="man">man</span> along
            with us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hektor to
            whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a god." </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 23</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            Thus did they make their moan throughout the
            city, while the Achaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every <span class="man">man</span> to his own ship. But Achilles
            would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave comrades saying,
            "Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends, not yet, I say, let us
            unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroklos,
            in due honor to the dead. When we have had full comfort of lamentation we will
            unyoke our horses and take supper all of us here." </div>
         <div>
            As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hektor
            with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of
            Patroklos. The others then put off every <span class="man">man</span> his armor, took the horses from
            their chariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the
            fleet descendant of Aiakos,</div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had
            said. They made haste to prepare the meal, they ate, and every <span class="man">man</span> had his full
            share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and
            drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of
            Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the sounding sea, in an
            open place where the waves came surging in one after another. Here a very deep
            slumber took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs
            were weary with chasing Hektor round windy Ilion. Presently the sad spirit [psukhê] of Patroklos drew near him, like what he had been in
            stature, voice, and the light of his beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been
            clad in life. The spirit hovered over his head and said- </div>
         <div>
            "One prayer more will I make you, if you will
            grant it; let not my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them;
            even as we were brought up together in your own home, what time Menoitios
            brought me to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed
            the son of Amphidamas - not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over the
            dice. The horse<span class="man">man</span> Peleus took me into his house, entreated me kindly, and
            named me to be your squire [therapôn]; therefore
            let our bones lie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you
            by your mother." </div>
         <div>
            When they had thrown down their great logs of
            wood over the whole ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but
            Achilles ordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armor, and to yoke each
            <span class="man">man</span> his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armor and mounted each his
            chariot - they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went before, and
            they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after. In
            the midst of them his comrades bore Patroklos and covered him with the locks of
            their hair which they cut off and threw upon his body. Last came Achilles with
            his head bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house of
            Hades. </div>
         <div>
            Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of
            chariots bestirred themselves. First among them all uprose Eumelos, king of
            men, son of Admetos, a <span class="man">man</span> excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty
            Diomedes son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken from
            Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him, yellow-haired
            Menelaos son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon's mare Aithe,
            and his own horse Podagros. The mare had been given to Agamemnon by Echepolos
            son of Anchises, that he might not have to follow him to Ilion, but might stay at home and take his
            ease; for Zeus had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious
            Sicyon. This mare, all eager for
            the race, did Menelaos put under the yoke. </div>
         <div>
            Fourth in order Antilokhos, son to noble Nestor
            son of Neleus, made ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up to him to give
            him good advice of which, however, he stood in but little need. "Antilokhos,"
            said Nestor, "you are young, but Zeus and Poseidon have loved you well, and
            have made you an excellent horseman. I need not therefore say much by way of
            instruction. You are skillful at wheeling your horses round the post, but the
            horses themselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your
            chances. The other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter;
            therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice [mêtis] whereby you may insure that the prize shall not
            slip through your fingers. The woodsman does more by skill [mêtis] than by brute force [biê]; by skill [mêtis] the pilot guides
            his storm-tossed ship over the sea [pontos], and so
            by skill [mêtis] one driver can beat another. If a
            <span class="man">man</span> go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a <span class="man">man</span> of craft [kerdos] may have worse horses, but he will keep them
            well in hand when he sees the turning-post [terma];</div>
         <div>
            he knows the precise moment at which to pull
            the rein, and keeps his eye well on the <span class="man">man</span> in front of him. I will give you
            this certain sign [sêma] which cannot escape your
            notice. There is a stump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be - some six
            feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork
            of the road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is a clear
            course all round it. It may have been a tomb [sêma]
            of someone who died long ago, or it may have been used as a turning-post in
            days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark [terma] round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as
            close as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the
            left; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose
            rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of your wheel
            shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your horses
            and break your chariot in pieces, which would be sport for others but confusion
            for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you
            can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one giving you the
            go-by later, not even though you had Adrastos' horse Arion behind you horse
            which is of divine race - or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest in this
            country." </div>
         <div>
            When Nestor had made an end of counseling his
            son he sat down in his place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses.
            They then all mounted their chariots and cast lots. - Achilles shook the
            helmet, and the lot of Antilokhos son of Nestor fell out first; next came that
            of King Eumelos, and after his, those of Menelaos son of Atreus and of
            Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomedes son of Tydeus, who was the
            best <span class="man">man</span> of them all. They took their places in line; Achilles showed them the
            turning-post round which they were to turn, some way off upon the plain; here
            he stationed his father's follower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and
            report truly. </div>
         <div>
            But Antilokhos plied his whip, and drove
            faster, as though he had not heard him. They went side by side for about as far
            as a young <span class="man">man</span> can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his
            strength, and then Menelaos' mares drew behind, for he left off driving for
            fear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, while
            pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the ground.
            Menelaos then upbraided Antilokhos and said, "There is no greater trickster
            living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well
            that you have understanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the
            prize [athlon] without sworn protest on my part." </div>
         <div>
            Next after him came in Antilokhos of the race
            of Neleus, who had passed Menelaos by craft [kerdos] and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even so Menelaos
            came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that draws both the
            chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse's tail touch the tire of the
            wheel, and there is never much space between wheel and horse when the chariot
            is going; Menelaos was no further than this behind Antilokhos, though at first
            he had been a full disc's throw behind him. He had soon caught him up again,
            for Agamemnon's mare Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the
            course had been longer he would have passed him, and there would not even have
            been a dead heat. Idomeneus' brave squire [therapôn] Meriones was about a spear's cast behind Menelaos. His horses
            were slowest of all in the contest [agôn], and he
            was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetos, dragging his
            chariot and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry,
            and stood up among the Argives saying, "The best <span class="man">man</span> is coming in last. Let us
            give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the first
            must go to the son of Tydeus." </div>
         <div>
            Thus did he speak and the others all of them
            applauded his saying, and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son
            Antilokhos stood up and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. "Achilles,"
            said he, "I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of
            my prize [athlon], because you think Eumelos'
            chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself too, good <span class="man">man</span> that he is. He
            should have prayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he
            had done so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your
            tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle, and horses. Take something from this store
            if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize
            [athlon] even than that which you have now
            offered; but I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her,
            let him come on." </div>
         <div>
            But Menelaos got up in a rage, furiously angry
            with Antilokhos. An attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the
            Argives keep silence: the hero then addressed them. "Antilokhos," said he,
            "what is this from you who have been so far blameless? You have shamed my
            excellence [aretê] and baulked my horses by
            flinging your own in front of them, though yours are much worse than mine are;
            therefore, O princes and counselors of the Argives, judge between us and show
            no favor, lest one of the Achaeans say, ‘Menelaos has got the mare through
            lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilokhos', but he is
            superior in excellence [aretê] and force [biê].’ Nay, I will determine the matter myself, and no
            <span class="man">man</span> will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come here, Antilokhos, and
            stand, as our custom [themis] is, whip in hand
            before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by
            earth-encircling Poseidon that you did not purposely and guilefully get in the
            way of my horses." </div>
         <div>
            And Antilokhos answered, "Forgive me; I am much
            younger, King Menelaos, than you are; you stand higher than I do and are the
            better <span class="man">man</span> of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into
            indiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have less judgment [noos]; make due allowances therefore, and bear with
            me; I will of my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claim
            any further chattel from my own possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at
            once, than fall from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the eyes of
            daimones." </div>

            As he spoke there stood up a champion both
            brave and great stature, a skillful boxer, Epeios, son of Panopeus. He laid his
            hand on the mule and said, "Let the <span class="man">man</span> who is to have the cup come hither, for
            none but myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present,
            and none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of you in
            actual fighting? Still, no <span class="man">man</span> can be good at everything. I tell you plainly,
            and it shall come true; if any <span class="man">man</span> will box with me I will bruise his body and
            break his bones; therefore let his friends stay here in a body and be at hand
            to take him away when I have done with him." </div>
         <div>
            They all held their peace, and no <span class="man">man</span> rose save
            Euryalos son of Mekisteus, who was son of Talaos. Mekisteus went once to
            Thebes after the fall of
            Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus. The son
            of Tydeus was Euryalos' second, cheering him on and hoping heartily that he
            would win. First he put a waistband round him and then he gave him some
            well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the middle of
            the ring [agôn], and immediately fell to; heavily
            indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with their brawny fists.
            One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every
            pore of their skin. Presently Epeios came on and gave Euryalos a blow on the
            jaw as he was looking round; Euryalos could not keep his legs; they gave way
            under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the
            air near some shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the
            top of the waves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeios caught
            hold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led him
            from the ring [agôn], unsteady in his gait, his
            head hanging on one side, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down
            in a swoon and then went to fetch the double cup. </div>
         <div>
            Antilokhos carried off the last prize [athlon] and smiled as he said to the bystanders, "You
            all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown their respect for
            seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as for Odysseus, he belongs to
            an earlier generation, but he is hale in spite of his years, and no <span class="man">man</span> of the
            Achaeans can run against him save only Achilles." </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Scroll 24</h1>
      <div>
         <div>
            The assembly [agôn]
            now broke up and the people went their ways each to his own ship. There they
            made ready their supper, and then bethought them of the blessed boon of sleep;
            but Achilles still wept for thinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, before
            whom all things bow, could take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn
            as he yearned after the might and manfulness of Patroklos; he thought of all
            they had done together, and all they had gone through both on the field of
            battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept
            bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now face downwards, till
            at last he rose and went out as one distraught to wander upon the seashore.
            Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his
            chariot, and bound the body of Hektor behind it that he might drag it about.
            Thrice did he drag it round the tomb [sêma] of the
            son of Menoitios, and then went back into his tent, leaving the body on the
            ground full length and with its face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it
            to be disfigured, for he pitied the <span class="man">man</span>, dead though he now was; therefore he
            shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt
            while Achilles was dragging him. </div>
         <div>
            When, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day
            had now come, Phoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, "You gods ought
            to be ashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hektor
            burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare you not
            rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with his mother and
            child, his father Priam, and his people, who would forthwith commit him to the
            flames, and give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you would all be on the
            side of mad Achilles, who knows neither right nor ruth? He is like some savage
            lion that in the pride of his great strength [biê]
            and spirit [thumos] springs upon men's flocks and
            gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that decency
            [aidôs] which at once so greatly banes yet
            greatly boons him that will heed it. <span class="man">man</span> may lose one far dearer than Achilles
            has lost- a son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother's womb; yet
            when he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes
            much sorrow to kill a <span class="man">man</span>; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain noble
            Hektor, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb [sêma] of his comrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he
            should not do so, for brave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should
            vent his fury upon dead clay." </div>
         <div>
            On this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to
            deliver her message. She went to Priam's house, and found weeping and
            lamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in the outer
            courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the old <span class="man">man</span> sat in the midst
            of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and neck all
            covered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay groveling in the mire.
            His daughters and his sons' wives went wailing about the house, as they thought
            of the many and brave men who lost their life-breath [psukhê], slain by the Argives. The messenger of Zeus stood by Priam
            and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. "Take heart,"
            she said, "Priam offspring of Dardanos, take heart and fear not. I bring no evil tidings, but
            am minded well towards you. I come as a messenger from Zeus, who though he be
            not near, takes thought for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble Hektor,
            and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. </div>
         <div>
            His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and
            said, "Alas, what has become of that judgment for which you have been ever
            famous both among strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to
            the ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many
            of your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage sees
            you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let us then
            weep Hektor from afar here in our own house, for when I gave him birth the
            threads of overruling fate were spun for him that dogs should eat his flesh far
            from his parents, in the house of that terrible <span class="man">man</span> on whose liver I would fain
            fasten and devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when
            Achilles slew him, and thought neither of Right nor of avoiding battle as he
            stood in defense of Trojan men and Trojan women." </div>
         <div>
            Then Priam said, "I would go, do not therefore
            stay me nor be as a bird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had
            it been some mortal <span class="man">man</span> who had sent me some seer [mantis] or priest who divines from sacrifice - I should have deemed
            him false and have given him no heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen
            her face to face, therefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If
            it be my fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it; let
            Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms and mourned
            him to my heart's comforting." </div>
         <div>
            He drove the men away with his staff, and they
            went forth as the old <span class="man">man</span> sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding
            Helenos, Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon,
            Antiphonos, Polites of the loud battle-cry, Deiphobos, Hippothoos, and Dios.
            These nine did the old <span class="man">man</span> call near him. "Come to me at once," he cried,
            "worthless sons who do me shame; </div>
         <div>
            would that you had all been killed at the ships
            rather than Hektor. Miserable <span class="man">man</span> that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all
            Troy - noble Nestor, Troilus the
            dauntless charioteer, and Hektor who was a god among men, so that one would
            have thought he was son to an immortal - yet there is not one of them left.
            Ares has slain them and those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars,
            and light of foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own
            people, why do you not get a wagon ready for me at once, and put all these
            things upon it that I may set out on my way?" </div>
         <div>
            And Priam answered, "Wife, I will do as you
            desire me; it is well to lift hands in prayer to Zeus, if so be he may have
            mercy upon me." With this the old <span class="man">man</span> bade the serving-woman pour pure water
            over his hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed his
            hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering and
            prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his eyes to heaven.
            "Father Zeus," he said, "you who rule from Ida, most glorious and most great,
            grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately in the tents of
            Achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen
            which is strongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with my
            own eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans." </div>
         <div>
            So did he pray, and Zeus the lord of counsel
            heard his prayer. Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all
            birds that fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings
            were spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and well-bolted door
            of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flying over the city upon their right
            hands, and when they saw him they were glad and their hearts took comfort
            within them. The old <span class="man">man</span> made haste to mount his chariot, and drove out through
            the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before
            him went the mules drawing the four-wheeled wagon, and driven by wise Idaios;
            behind these were the horses, which the old <span class="man">man</span> lashed with his whip and drove
            swiftly through the city, </div>
         <div>
            But Priam and Idaios as they showed out upon
            the plain did not escape the ken of all-seeing Zeus, who looked down upon the
            old <span class="man">man</span> and pitied him; then he spoke to his son Hermes and said, "Hermes, for
            it is you who are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear
            those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of the Achaeans
            that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note of him until he reach
            the son of Peleus." </div>
         <div>
            Thus he spoke and Hermes, guide and guardian,
            slayer of Argos, did as he was told.
            Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly
            like the wind over land and sea; he took the wand with which he seals men's
            eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his
            hand till he came to Troy and to the
            Hellespont. To look at, he was like
            a young <span class="man">man</span> of noble birth in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down
            just coming upon his face. </div>
         <div>
            Now when Priam and Idaios had driven past the
            great tomb [sêma] of Ilion, they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink
            in the river, for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaios saw
            Hermes standing near them he said to Priam, "Take heed, descendant of
            Dardanos; here is matter which
            demands consideration [noos]. I see a <span class="man">man</span> who I
            think will presently fall upon us; let us flee with our horses, or at least
            embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us? </div>
         <div>
            Then said the slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, "Sir, all that
            you have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking this rich
            treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, or are you all
            leaving strong Ilion in dismay now
            that your son has fallen who was the bravest <span class="man">man</span> among you and was never
            lacking in battle with the Achaeans?" </div>
         <div>
            The slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, answered him, "Sir, you would prove
            me, that you question me about noble Hektor. Many a time have I set eyes upon
            him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their ships and putting them
            to the sword. We stood still and marveled, for Achilles in his anger with the
            son of Atreus suffered us not to fight. I am his squire [therapôn], and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon, and
            my father's name is Polyktor: he is a rich <span class="man">man</span> and about as old as you are; he
            has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, and it fell
            upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to the
            plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set battle in array about the city.
            They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that their princes cannot hold
            them back." </div>
         <div>
            The old <span class="man">man</span> was comforted as he heard him and
            said, "My son, see what a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the
            immortals; for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that
            hold Olympus, and now they requite it
            to him even in death. Accept therefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard
            me and with heaven's help guide me till I come to the tent of the son of
            Peleus." </div>
         <div>
            With these words Hermes went back to high
            Olympus. Priam sprang from his
            chariot to the ground, leaving Idaios where he was, in charge of the mules and
            horses. The old <span class="man">man</span> went straight into the house where Achilles, loved of the
            gods, was sitting. There he found him with his men seated at a distance from
            him: only two, the hero Automedon, and Alkimos of the race of Ares, were busy
            in attendance about his person, for he had but just done eating and drinking, </div>
         <div>
            As when some cruel spite [atê] has befallen a <span class="man">man</span> that he should have killed some one in his
            own country, and must flee to a great man's protection in a land [dêmos] of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even
            so did Achilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another and
            marveled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, "Think of your father, O
            Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the sad threshold of
            old age. It may be that those who dwell near him harass him, and there is none
            to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he hears of you being still alive, he
            is glad, and his days are full of hope that he shall see his dear son come home
            to him from Troy; but I, wretched man
            that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had
            fifty sons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a single
            womb, and the others were borne to me by the women of my household. The greater
            part of them has fierce Ares laid low, and Hektor, him who was alone left, him
            who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him have you lately slain;
            therefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body from
            you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your
            own father and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have
            steeled myself as no <span class="man">man</span> yet has ever steeled himself before me, and have
            raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son." </div>
         <div>
            and had unburdened the bitterness of his
            sorrow, he left his seat and raised the old <span class="man">man</span> by the hand, in pity for his
            white hair and beard; then he said, "Unhappy <span class="man">man</span>, you have indeed been greatly
            daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the Achaeans, and
            enter the presence of him who has slain so many of your brave sons? You must
            have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for all our grief we will hide
            our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no
            care, yet the lot they spin for <span class="man">man</span> is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus'
            palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with
            good ones. He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will
            meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none
            but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine
            will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face
            of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus;
            the gods endowed him with all good things from his birth upwards, for he
            reigned over the Myrmidons excelling all men in prosperity [olbos] and wealth,
            and mortal though he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him
            too did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children born to
            him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all untimely; nor may I
            take care of him now that he is growing old, for I must stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children.
            And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy [olbios]. They say that in wealth and plenitude of
            offspring you surpassed all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is more inland, and those that
            dwell upon the great Hellespont; but
            from the day when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and
            slaughter have been about your city continually. </div>
         <div>
            Achilles looked at him sternly and said, "Vex
            me, sir, no longer; I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hektor. My
            mother, daughter of the old <span class="man">man</span> of the sea, came to me from Zeus to bid me
            deliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it, that
            some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else, no <span class="man">man</span> however
            strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host; he could neither pass
            our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates thus easily; therefore, provoke
            me no further, lest I err against the word of Zeus, and suffer you not,
            suppliant though you are, within my tents." </div>
         <div>
            The old <span class="man">man</span> feared him and obeyed. Then the son
            of Peleus sprang like a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with
            him went his two squires [therapontes] Automedon
            and Alkimos who were closer to him than any others of his comrades now that
            Patroklos was no more. These unyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam's
            herald and attendant be seated within the house. They lifted the ransom for
            Hektor's body from the wagon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt,
            that Achilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home.
            Then he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it,
            but he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it, lest if he did
            so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and enrage Achilles,
            who might then kill him and err against the word of Zeus. When the servants had
            washed the body and anointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle,
            Achilles himself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the
            wagon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade,
            "Be not angry with me, Patroklos," he said, "if you hear even in the house of
            Hades that I have given Hektor to his father for a ransom. It has been no
            unworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you." </div>

            When he heard this the old <span class="man">man</span> was afraid and
            roused his servant. Hermes then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them
            quickly through the host so that no <span class="man">man</span> perceived them. When they came to the
            ford of eddying Xanthos, begotten
            of immortal Zeus, Hermes went back to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over all
            the land. Priam and Idaios then drove on toward the city lamenting and making
            moan, and the mules drew the body of Hektor. No one neither <span class="man">man</span> nor woman saw
            them, </div>
         <div>
            At this there was not <span class="man">man</span> nor woman left in the
            city, so great a sorrow [penthos] had possessed
            them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was bringing in the body. Hektor's
            wife and his mother were the first to mourn him: they flew towards the wagon
            and laid their hands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them.
            They would have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day
            to the going down of the sun, had not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and
            said, "Make way for the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken the
            body home you shall have your fill of weeping." </div>
