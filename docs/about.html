        <h2>About our project</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on the relationship between Achilles and Patroklus. We aim to emphacize the fact that the greek translation is ambigious in terms of stating their relationship, since the same Greek word means both man and husband. Due to this, we are looking at an english version to prove that the Greek version is ambigious, but the word for man can be replaced by husband when referring to Achilles and Patroklus.</p>
